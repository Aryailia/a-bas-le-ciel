00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
calculating decision not to kill him and
 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.869 align:start position:0%

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 align:start position:0%
let him live because i thought the
 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.429 align:start position:0%
let him live because i thought the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
consequence of killing him would
 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.830 align:start position:0%
consequence of killing him would
probably<00:01:08.000><c> be</c><00:01:08.240><c> worse</c><00:01:08.880><c> than</c><00:01:09.119><c> just</c><00:01:09.360><c> letting</c><00:01:09.600><c> him</c>

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
probably be worse than just letting him
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.190 align:start position:0%
probably be worse than just letting him
live<00:01:10.159><c> because</c><00:01:10.320><c> i'd</c><00:01:10.479><c> probably</c><00:01:10.799><c> be</c><00:01:10.960><c> found</c>

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
live because i'd probably be found
 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.390 align:start position:0%
live because i'd probably be found
guilty<00:01:11.520><c> of</c><00:01:11.600><c> murder</c>

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
guilty of murder
 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.550 align:start position:0%
guilty of murder
so<00:01:12.640><c> no</c><00:01:12.880><c> and</c><00:01:12.960><c> that</c><00:01:13.119><c> was</c><00:01:13.280><c> when</c><00:01:13.520><c> i</c><00:01:13.680><c> was</c><00:01:13.920><c> about</c><00:01:14.320><c> yeah</c>

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
so no and that was when i was about yeah
 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.390 align:start position:0%
so no and that was when i was about yeah
in<00:01:14.720><c> fourth</c><00:01:14.960><c> grade</c><00:01:15.280><c> i</c><00:01:15.360><c> think</c><00:01:15.439><c> that's</c><00:01:15.759><c> not</c><00:01:15.920><c> even</c>

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
in fourth grade i think that's not even

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
get come up with an argument but um yeah
 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.550 align:start position:0%
get come up with an argument but um yeah
it<00:03:10.640><c> feels</c><00:03:10.959><c> funny</c><00:03:11.200><c> at</c><00:03:11.360><c> first</c><00:03:11.840><c> changing</c><00:03:12.319><c> your</c>

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
so it would be
 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
so it would be
