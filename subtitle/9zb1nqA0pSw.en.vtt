we expect it to explode um
 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.230 align:start position:0%
we expect it to explode um
it's<00:07:12.560><c> weird</c><00:07:12.800><c> if</c><00:07:12.880><c> it</c><00:07:12.960><c> doesn't</c><00:07:13.199><c> explode</c><00:07:13.599><c> frankly</c>

then<00:07:24.400><c> then</c><00:07:24.880><c> we</c><00:07:25.039><c> should</c><00:07:25.199><c> be</c>

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
then then we should be
