violations<00:00:16.160><c> it's</c><00:00:16.320><c> kind</c><00:00:16.480><c> of</c><00:00:16.560><c> like</c><00:00:16.720><c> the</c>

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
violations it's kind of like the
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.230 align:start position:0%
violations it's kind of like the
non-aggression<00:00:17.520><c> principle</c><00:00:18.160><c> so</c><00:00:18.800><c> like</c><00:00:19.119><c> um</c><00:00:19.840><c> the</c>

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
non-aggression principle so like um the
 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.710 align:start position:0%
non-aggression principle so like um the
problem<00:00:20.720><c> i</c><00:00:20.880><c> have</c><00:00:21.199><c> is</c><00:00:21.359><c> that</c>

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
problem i have is that
 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.750 align:start position:0%
problem i have is that
predators<00:00:23.519><c> are</c><00:00:23.680><c> the</c><00:00:23.840><c> ones</c><00:00:24.400><c> violating</c><00:00:25.279><c> others</c>

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
predators are the ones violating others
 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.870 align:start position:0%
predators are the ones violating others
rights

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
rights
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.830 align:start position:0%
rights
so

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.549 align:start position:0%
so
yeah<00:00:28.240><c> like</c><00:00:28.560><c> obviously</c><00:00:29.279><c> i'm</c><00:00:30.000><c> more</c><00:00:30.640><c> in</c><00:00:30.880><c> favor</c><00:00:31.279><c> of</c>

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
yeah like obviously i'm more in favor of
 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.430 align:start position:0%
yeah like obviously i'm more in favor of
