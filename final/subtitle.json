[{"id":"4biK7a6ccGU","text":"i've been on this enlightenment spiritual journey for the past like two months and like it really has helped meditation you know i've been doing everything from like just every religion every meditative source energy spirit guide all that bruh [Music] and has really connected me the most to god [Music] and one of them is ironically unironically to have a plant-based vegan diet to not eat meat [Music] mentally like i just know that's the path i'm meant to be on so all that to say yes i just posted a kfc video [Music] honestly like it made me feel sick like that was like literally poisoning my body right after i think i'm checking and the minute like yeah it's only been a few days or whatever that i'm like vegan or whatever but the the minute i did i felt like i was healing myself and i don't know if it's the krishna yoga i don't know i i don't know i'm telling you right now like fast food is poisonous but i realize i'm like i've been literally feeding myself poison you've got to do real things for real reasons and the problem with religion any religion each and every religion the problem with religion is that it conditions us to do real things for fictional reasons the hindu scriptures are fiction the buddhist sutras are fiction the bible and the quran are works of fiction and if you know people face to face if you care about people it's hard to discourage them when they start improving their own lives when they start doing the right things for the wrong reasons if you know someone who quit smoking because he found jesus or you know someone who quit drinking alcohol because that inspirational dialogue with a buddhist monk and tried meditating for 15 minutes it's hard to take a step back and say to that person it may be your own brother it may be your own father it may be your own sister or mother someone you're close to and say no don't do this because even if it's an improvement now in the short term even if you're making your life better even if you're making your health better if you start doing the right thing for the wrong reasons inevitably it's going to lead to you doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons all these subjective feelings she describes of being so thrilled by her new diet the sense of having a breakthrough and new motivation in our life men feel that when they cheat on their wives and i hate to tell you this it already has been made into a religion it's actually one of the world's oldest and most influential religions taoism oh yeah yeah you know you gotta balance out your yin and your yang older guy sleeping with a younger woman you believe it or not there's like a metaphysical and religious justification for why you feel so good about yourself when you cheat on your wife with the younger woman [Music] you can talk yourself into anything you can talk yourself into believing that you're gonna go to heaven after you die for killing the infidels i'm not really interested in comparing one excuse to another and saying oh that's a better excuse than another i'm not really interested in looking at the hindu reasons for vegetarianism right and comparing them to buddhist reasons and if you didn't know there are some really crazy forms of christianity that also encourage vegetarianism and veganism all right if veganism is something good and important and worthwhile if it's something positive that you should do then you should also do it for the right reasons if sobriety is something important and worthwhile something you want to attain something you want to achieve then you've got to be sober for the right reasons being sober for god it's just as nonsensical as doing any other real thing for the sake of fiction"},{"id":"858vVQCpz8E","text":"we live our lives as the prisoners of thoughts that seem plausible but can never be true this is just as terrifying in the sciences as it is within religion it seems plausible that if you do good deeds you'll go to heaven after you die if you do good deeds you'll be reincarnated as a better person whereas those who do bad deeds will be punished and things will turn out terribly for them it seems plausible in the same way as a sort of moral fable that if each of us just pitches in and does our part if we all just do our best we can beat global warming by recycling glass bottles by taking fewer vacations by reducing the number of airplanes being used for tourism i have viewers in the audience of different ages some of you will not be old enough to remember september 11 2001 and the first few months of 2002 thereafter let me tell you that was the single most dramatic decline in international air transport in the history of the world to that time there was a sudden abrupt reduction in the number of airplanes flying around the world did you hear anyone saying oh wow and just look at the number of parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere look at how it's reduced look at how it's gone down i've had several people say to me on the internet just in the last few months that they believe or they presume that reducing the number of airplanes in circulation will solve the carbon pollution crisis and they point to what's happened in just the last few years 2019 2020 and now 2021 and indeed this is about the most extreme reduction of tourism international air transport that you could have under sort of voluntary conditions without really having government policies or the outbreak of a war that forces people to stop taking flights look at the charts i have on street view right now there was no reduction in the parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere in 2019 2020 and in the year 2021 these statistics are accurate up to the middle of september 2021. it did not make a difference it did not even slow down the rate at which the problem is getting worse and if you haven't seen this type of chart a million times before in case you are diluting yourself into imagining that we're still within the normal range for carbon in the atmosphere no the orange line on the right hand side of the chart shows how far we are above whatever could be considered normal going back in history not just hundreds of years but many many thousands of years and here's the thing the world's gonna end the world as we know it is over because even if you can cope with the sun's rays coming in even if you can for example deploy satellites to reflect away excess solar radiation even if you can manage the temperature change or the rise of the oceans or maintain ice packs on the top of the mountains in india that provide river water that's crucial to the lives of about a billion people even if you can do all that even if you can manage everything as brilliantly as possible the simple fact that there is more carbon in the atmosphere means that the acidity of the oceans is increasing that the whole ecosystem of the ocean including the tiniest forms of life including the constituent components of coral reefs anything and everything in the ocean that relies on calcium which is pretty much all life in the ocean as we know it the whole food chain of the ocean will be wiped out and yes in case you didn't know it that whole food chain is also related to the production of oxygen the production of clouds it's a huge part of what makes life on earth as we know it possible now so we are looking at game over for the oceans even in the best case scenario of all the other coping mechanisms stuff like elon musk here posing with his brand new uh his brand new system of of roofing and solar panels right all of these things proposed to us currently by government experts by people with phds who are now being interviewed on the news okay all of them are a god damn joke and you know what's worse do you know who's worse we are people like us are even worse because i can say about elon musk he's still out there trying he is still out there quite literally building solar roofs and i'm the guy's harshest critic but i've got to hand it to him he's born rich he had a successful career he got richer what did he want to do with his millions of dollars he wanted to save the world he's made a lot of mistakes along the way in some cases he's done more harm than good but i can say that he is still out there with his millions of dollars humbly trying to nail solar panels onto people's rooftops to do his part and we the vegans of youtube five years ago we were so committed to this notion of lifestyle activism that what we were going to do is display beautiful bodies in bikinis in front of beaches we were going to change the world and we didn't even change youtube this is the reality the woman in the bikini you've just been looking at is tess begg and she is typical in as much as her commitment to this cause her commitment to promoting veganism her commitment to saving the world just plain evaporated it just disappeared as soon as the money stopped flowing in and i feel this is true across the board i feel it's true across our whole strange category of so-called activism there was a time when she could relatively effortlessly get half a million views in a month and now she's at a point where she has to work very hard just to get a few thousand views and you know what she stops trying she stops making the effort all the people who were pretending that they were far more committed to this cause than elon musk all the people who looked down their noses at people like elon musk and one generation of political leaders after another as they came and went and said oh we're not like them we're morally superior to those people we are the ones who are truly going to save the planet you know what i think all of them were unaware of themselves at the extent to which they were just motivated by money fame power respect and sex and once they got their money and got their fame and gotten laid they took their bag of money and they goddamn left and i would say this about a lot of people in lab coats a lot of people are supposedly respectable scientists who have made millions of dollars out of this game and they are not trying to save the world either i want to close this video by asking you a very simple question when you look at these charts today when you look at these hopeless charts can you remember what your own attitude was 10 years ago what your expectations were 20 years ago i think a lot of you if you're really being honest and reflecting probably 20 years ago you thought oh well yeah this is bad this carbon dioxide in the atmosphere thing is bad or you might have even known specifically about ocean acidification oh this is bad but it's getting better and better now oh looking forward next five years 10 years 50 years all these famous people whether you're thinking of sexy influencers in bikinis or multi-millionaires who are captains of industry or the leading politicians in america france germany england everyone is preaching from the same prayer book everyone's inside everyone supports discussions so from here it can only get better and better well guess what look at the line on the chart it got worse and it has continued to get worse during 2019 2020 2021 there are no effective halfway measures reducing airplane transport won't do it we're looking at two options and we need coercive action on either one now either we engage in public education and coercion on a massive scale to force humanity to transition to a vegan diet or we look at radically reducing the number of human beings on planet earth of those two ethically and politically and pragmatically i know which one i'd support just a few weeks ago i had this long in-depth discussion on the channel if you haven't seen it watch it now and it's several points during that discussion i point the finger at my audience and say not one of you is gonna send me an email after i make this video falling on this i'm not gonna get one email talking about taking action and instead i'm gonna continue getting a whole bunch of [ __ ] emails about my sex life some of which are from people who want to gossip about it some of which are from people who actually want to [ __ ] me whatever whether i'm flattered or annoyed by this is immaterial during that video you'll hear me say look we supposedly have gathered here in this audience today some of the most intelligent the best informed and the most cynical people who've ever been in the vegan community what are you going to do about it because i know i'm not even going to get one email and i don't have one colleague to work with there's nothing i can do there's nobody i can call that's where i'm at as i creep closer to 6 million views total on youtube it seems so plausible that some scientists in a lab coat that some government official that someone somewhere wealthier more powerful more influential than yourself is gonna solve this problem and i think we live with that seemingly plausible myth the same way that people live with the expectation of going to heaven or hell after they died throughout the dark ages what i'm saying to you now is no nobody else is going to do it for you nobody is coming to save you neither elon musk nor tess begg in her bikini neither millionaire activism nor consumer activism nor lifestyle activism nothing is going to make the difference i'm turning to you in the audience and asking how about you [Music] you"},{"id":"HitZdjrhphY","text":"this story would not be so surprising if we were talking about a gang of communists it would not be so surprised we were talking about a gang of neo-nazis but we're here talking about a bunch of predominantly fruitarian hippies we're talking about a bunch of vegans who are supposedly going to save the planet for preaching compassion ecology and all the rest of it and here i am in an alleyway facing down two guys who have orders from their cult leader to kick my ass i think it would be reassuring to imagine that these eccentrics i was meeting in this alleyway in chiang mai that the whole gang of them the various uh cast and crew surrounding freely and durianrider at that time that they were somehow wildly eccentric that they were so different from you and i are ourselves but they're not they're dreadfully dismal normal people and that's what makes it really scary that's what makes it really haunting is recognizing that normal people become communists normal people become neo-nazis normal people become vegan yes but then they go on to disappoint you or even horrify you when they become ex-vegan become pro-carnivore become advocates for eating raw meat raw butter you name it what makes the story meaningful ultimately is that these aren't monsters they're dismally normal people [Music] what could be less interesting than a story about a fist fight in an alleyway in chiang mai thailand in 2016. how about a story about a fistfight in an alleyway that never quite happened a fistfight that could have happened but somehow the puzzle pieces didn't quite fit together was talking to this other youtuber ethie and he really insisted to me that i ought to tell this story that i want to make a youtube video about it at least so that he can take a clip of it and put it on his own channel i said what do you what do you really find so interesting about this he said that he thought it was kind of spooky and kind of haunting so here we are as we come up on uh halloween of 2021 and i suppose this is my my halloween story uh to share with you what what do i find interesting about this what do i find spooky or haunting about this story in looking back at the year 2016 and the ungodly events that took place in chiang mai you know the whole vegan movement came to a crossroads and made a series of faithful decisions the movement as such took on new directions and individual people within that movement made decisions and took on new directions that changed their lives forever you know who was there yeah i was there durianrider was there freely was there paul beshear was there right joey carbstrong was there get into the list and think about how their lives changed in the months immediately thereafter as my confrontation with durianrider and the divorce between durianrider and freelee brought on a new wave of skepticism and frankly recrimination within the movement durianrider had made it very clear on facebook on youtube on every form of social media he had at his disposal including sending out emails to his minions and followers he had made it very clear that i was to be hunted down and beaten up in the streets of chiang mai and he told me this directly he sent messages to me directly saying that there were roving gangs of his followers who knew my address who would find me and who would in the parlance of our times kick my ass that morning i woke up and looked out the window i had jet lag my sleep cycle was all screwed up so it was very very early in the morning and when i looked out the window of my apartment i had a window that looked into the hallway not at the outset but the hallway within the apartment standing right there at my door was a guy dressed head to toe in skin tight green long distance biking jersey material you know those zip up jackets cyclists wear those those funny shorts and you know i didn't feel scared i didn't feel angry i wake up you know you're still a little bit girl you're just a little bit asleep you look out you see this guy standing right in front of my door and you think oh so it wasn't just [ __ ] you know so okay so we're really gonna do this okay so they found where i live they they came to my door and you know there was a sense of relief like all this isn't for nothing it isn't just smoke without fire okay it's really going down and then you know there was that sound and the the elevator doors opened and this guy got in and went down and left it was that that was a complete coincidence the guy wasn't wasn't even vegan you know he was just wearing the kind of outfit that the vegan followers of dirty writer already happened to be in the hallway of my apartment building so it didn't happen at that time but i did have about four face-to-face confrontations with durianrider followers who are at varying degrees of expecting to attempt to kick my ass or for me to try to kick their ass in self-defense that they thought some kind of fist fight was was gonna eventuate each of those stories was very different one of those guys he he had been named by durianrider i had been told when during other people oh that this guy in particular was gonna hunt me down and kick my ass and beat me up many of his promises just vaguely alluded to him having gangs of followers he had so many devotees and followers in chiang mai who would find but this guy had been named in specific and i was actually in a shopping mall in chiang mai and i walked up on him completely self-confidently just walked around oh hey you know like you know i think the first thing i said was something like are you going to pretend you don't know who i am you're going to pretend you don't see me you know like hey like i know who you are you know who i am you know you gonna you're gonna make something happen or not and that guy i mean right away he was just like oh look look man i want you to know i mean durianrider said that stuff i'm not i'm not gonna try to beat you up i'm not gonna try to kick your ass and we had a very memorable conversation and you know like so many people who are mentioned or alluded to in this story within one year that guy's whole life had changed uh that guy even that guy he stayed in touch with me he sent me messages as he became more and more disillusioned with durianrider he found out the extent to which that whole movement was based on like a sand castle made out of lies and you know his life had to take on a new direction you know as he lost the sense of hope and motivation that came from this direction this commitment to this particular part of the vegan movement yeah it was uh it was much more his personal tragedy than it was mine my situation in this alleyway with walking up on two guys one of whom was the notorious jack green most of thailand and certainly the city of chiang mai itself is made up of narrow alleyways and this was an alleyway in broad daylight in the tropics so it's a very it's a brightly lit alleyway it's not dark or inherently dangerous but there just isn't that much space so i'm walking down this alleyway and i can see them a long way ahead of me on the side of the road at least one of them had his bike there you know they both have you know bicycles and bike helmets i think one of them the bike is chained one of them has the bike in front of them and they're standing there having a conversation that's why they don't see me coming for nearly as long as i see them so from their perspective all of a sudden whoa here's six foot three two hundred and twenty ten pound isil mazard right on top of us and look what's going through your mind at that point you know am i going to be friendly to these guys am i going to be nice to these guys am i going to walk up on them and say hey i know who you are you know who i am is this going down or what you don't want to instigate something if it's not going to happen anyway but if it is going to happen if it's not all smoke without fire if durianrider is being sincere and saying he has gangs of his followers trying to hunt me down and kick my ass these two particular guys they would be exactly the guys to do it because they were at that time 100 percent devoted during writer called flunkies and again this was a crossroads in their lives so soon thereafter everything changed both of these guys became completely disillusioned with durham writer became completely disillusioned with the movement they took on new directions not just in their youtube channels but in their lives and both of them stayed in touch with me both of them talked to me several times after the event uh again it turned out to be much more their personal tragedy than it was mine anyway i walk up to these two guys they had just been eating lunch with the followers of durianrider they had been going out to dinner with doreen ryder and freely and riding their bikes to the top of the mountain and attending the lecturers from durianrider and freely some of which were directly denouncing me they were absolutely in the hot house of followers who were receiving those facebook messages and watching those youtube videos as they came out there's absolutely no way they could have been unaware of the conflict that was boiling over between myself and theory writer which fundamentally was about the fact that i was a rival leader in the vegan movement that it was a challenge's authority and while i was there there were a whole lot of vegans who reached out to me as a kind of touchstone of authenticity as someone who both symbolized and actually was an alternative to the style and substance of vegan activism offered by dorian ryder and freely and all those people their lives changed so much you know that year or within a few months of that event i met one woman who became the lesbian girlfriend of henia yes henya mania they've now long since broken up but i forget they were together for a year or year and a half or something each of these people was following their own peculiar fate on a winding winding road leading off each one in a in a different direction but there were people there who were happy to see me and yeah there were people there who were aware that there were orders from doreen ryder to kick my ass and these two guys in this alleyway at that time i knew which one they were so look i'm not that big but i'm bigger than these guys there's two of them there's one of me i'm six foot three 220 pounds i'm doing push-ups and lifting weights every day i am prepared in every way mentally and physically for this conflict if it's gonna happen and they don't see me coming whereas i do see them in the distance so i come up to them and i basically say look [Laughter] and they respond by playing dumb they very nervously insisted that they had no idea what dorian ryder had been saying about me they hadn't seen any of those videos or gotten any of those facebook message they they behaved as if they were hearing it from me for the first time that durianrider had sent the word out for guys exactly like them to find me beat me up and possibly drag me away to durianrider's lair i suppose to be judged by him that there is this open order out for me to be to be beaten down now as i said in the only interview with a journalist i ever gave on this topic this story would not be so surprising if we were talking about a gang of communists it would not be so surprised we were talking about a gang of neo-nazis but we're here talking about a bunch of predominantly fruitarian hippies we're talking about a bunch of vegans who are supposedly going to save the planet who are preaching compassion ecology and all the rest of it and here i am in an alley way facing down two guys who have orders from their cult leader to kick my ass you know these guys these guys didn't say it the other guy i alluded to earlier who met me one-on-one in that shopping mall one of the first things he said to me was whoa you're a lot bigger than i was expecting [Laughter] thanks thanks for your cancer he also he also asked me uh uh when he was sitting he asked me how much i could bench press i remember it was part of the conversation and and in this conversation the conversation in the alleyway i didn't bring it up one of the two guys he's quite a small slender guy uh he decided to tell me that he was a kung fu enthusiast he's like you know i'm not really into long distance cycling i was like oh really he's like oh yeah yeah he's into he's into kung fu kung fu brazilian jiu jitsu mixed martial one of those are all of the above that he was a he was a martial arts guy well you missed your chance to show me rather than tell me homie the tragedy of this is of course that these people did have good intentions but they chose bad leaders jack green would go on to become an incredibly notorious figure he went from one extreme ideology the next he became a neo-nazi by the strictest definition imaginable making youtube videos directly quoting and praising adolf hitler a lot of these people you can trace the tortuous trail of the terrible decisions they made in their life through chiang mai thailand and for each and every one of them it was a major crossroads some of those people became devourers of raw meat became carnivores became ex-vegans who denounced the vegan movements others still just denounced the leadership of freely and durianrider but became vegan leaders in their own right but it's not just when you're away on holiday it's not just when you're attending a conference a party an event it's not just in these momentous occasions that are marked in advance on your calendar and it's not just when you're facing down the possibility of a fist fight in an alleyway you know that you're at an important moral crossroads in your life you get to choose ethically intellectually emotionally who you're going to be and what kind of person you're going to become the problem with the vegan movement then and the problem with the vegan movement now is not that we have too few vegans it's that we have too many people who are doing the right thing for the wrong reasons when you do the right thing for the wrong reasons it never can last people chose terrible leaders in the vegan movement because they had terrible motivations people were pursuing money fame power respect sex people were trying to get rich and famous on social media and in that moment in 2016 that possibility seemed more tantalizingly close than ever before it seemed as if you or you or you could be the next freely could be the next durian writer could be the next bonnie rebecca and nobody really stopped to think whether or not that would be a good thing for themselves or whether or not that'd be a good thing for the future of veganism for the fate of the movement as a whole you can see what happened to izzy davis you can see what happened to bonnie rebecca and i guess conversely you can see what happened to joey carbstrong how many of those people are still just doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do only the ones who in the first place did the right thing for the right reasons the people who didn't just become vegan as part of this endless pursuit of wealth fame and glory why do we tell stories about monsters is it to make us feel scared or is it to make us feel safe because ultimately none of us know any monsters none of us see any monsters and i think it would be reassuring to imagine that these eccentrics i was meeting in this alleyway in chiang mai that the whole gang of them the various uh cast and crew surrounding freely and durianrider at that time that they were somehow wildly eccentric that they were so different from you and i are ourselves but they're not they're dreadfully dismal normal people and that's what makes it really scary that's what makes it really haunting is recognizing that normal people become communists normal people become neo-nazis normal people become vegan yes but then they go on to disappoint you or

parents never like instilled anything that parents instill in you like structure responsibility or schedule i dropped out of high school at 15 because i couldn't even like go to school on time like so many of the mistakes i'd like i made in the beginning of my career were from lack of so many things like i needed you know yeah what's your opinion on marijuana do you smoke i personally don't smoke weed she's like how do i unlock it on a complete side note please no one put this in anything i'm so high that i can't feel the car movies i take adderall all the time you guys know so like i'll take like a fourth of a 20 milligram pill like five milligrams of batter in my bag everywhere i go i always have a pill bottle filled with adderall why does the bottle say that this is oxycodone and there's just there's not even oxycodone in there like the pain pills in there we're like hydrocodone like an adderall dealer in l.a and you happen to run across this hit my business email like i'm not offend like i'll just buy something to be real my family's like definitely very dead to me like we're still like i'll never i'll probably never talk to them again i'm already like too high to speak i don't even know how to say it but like my childhood was just the worst thing on earth and i'm very lucky to have gotten out of that but obviously i spent like 15 years of my life being so incredibly emotionally abused and physically abused and mentally abused and just like tormented and like i was raising myself all of those years and like i built up so much hatred for my parents and like so much anger for like the entire life that they've given me and it was like instantly i got thrown into this way out and obviously when you have a way out of a life like that you're going to take it this is one of the busiest intersections in this small city if you look at the grass carefully here you see there's a square that's darker green than the light green grass that's because there were tents set up here there were tents with drug addicts living all along this median all along this park for months and now instead there's a sign that doesn't say doesn't say pitching a tent is illegal it tells you which public parks the police will tolerate and encourage you to set up attention this is one of the busiest buildings in the whole city see the sliding front doors there in front of this uh grocery store i have seen a man in broad daylight get down on his knees right in front of that sliding door oblivious to the people moving around him take out a piece of tin foil a lighter and a glass pipe on his knees right there on the sidewalk with no hesitation with no shame this is not a bustling busy city some of you may be laughing saying this is the most busy intersection this is one of the busiest doors yeah it is this is basically a small town okay the streets are empty and yet everywhere you go they're filled with drug addicts yeah as never before you can see why most of the recording i do is indoors with indoor lighting but what you can't see is that in the few minutes between those takes where we walked from one park to another in downtown victoria we passed at least four drug addicts in various states of distress and it's not just my theory that these people were drug addicts some of them had the paraphernalia out in front of them they had the glass pipe out and one guy had passed out while standing upright some of you listen to this will have no idea what i'm talking about how can someone be blacked out and standing upright and some of you are living in cities that are so full of drug addicts like oh yeah i see that once a week okay we see the glass pipes we see the needles in people's arms and just in walking a few blocks really any blocks between any two points on the map here downtown of the city yeah that's a huge part of why so few of my videos are filmed outdoors what does tana mongeau have to do with homeless drug addicts living in tents on the street oh yeah we think about these things as if they're too completely separate categories as if the fact that you sleep in a mansion you sleep on a four-post bed makes the problem of drug addiction or the challenge of sobriety any different as if your ability to manage the consequences of your drug habit right your your ability to basically keep money in your bank account keep a roof over your head as if that makes it any less of a problem or as if in a really kind of perverse way we just think of people as being intellectually unequal ethically unequal right as if there are some people who are just born to live out their lives on the street hopelessly and then there are others who are in this category of i don't know highly effective people have the potential to to change the world well i don't believe that all right i think all of us have the positive potential to change the world and that's why it's so tragic that we have a whole generation of people now who are squandering it it's really easy to look at tana mongeau as if she had always been destined to turn out this way as if there were something wrong with her inherent in her character that guaranteed that she could not have accomplished something better for herself intellectually or ethically and we think this way because it's reassuring for us if we pass a homeless drug addict on the street and it happens to be someone you recognize it was someone you knew in college maybe it was someone you knew in high school maybe it's someone you knew as a little kid back in grade four back in kindergarten oh i remember that guy isn't it reassuring to think there must be something wrong with him there must be something wrong deep down inside that made it inevitable that he'd turn out like this and not me that somehow i'm morally different intellectually different special better and it's not true there aren't two classes of humanity one of which has the potential to make the world a better place and the other of which is just doomed and determined to be fixated on their own self-destruction on the dissipation of their potential through drugs and alcohol with someone like tana moncho you can go back and listen to her videos from five years ago you can hear how different she was you can see the potential she had yeah intellectually with someone like the amazing atheist you can go back five years you can go back 10 years and you can chart his intellectual decline or to flatter him his intellectual stagnation it's so tempting it's so easy to look at who he is today and then to see that as some kind of inevitable result of something that was wrong with him deep down inside there was nothing inevitable about tana mongeau dropping out of high school there was nothing inevitable about the amazing atheist dropping out of high school there was nothing inevitable about ali hardesty dropping out of college all of these people were intelligent enough to complete a university degree all of them if they get sober they still are now intelligent enough they still can develop they still can grow and a further reason why we tend to essentialize these problems treat them as a fundamental part of a person's character is that so many of the drug users themselves will present a narrative in this way whereby they are a victim of their circumstance tana mongeau explains to you in a moving way that she had terrible parents she had a terrible childhood she had a terrible upbringing and that that makes her who she is today but it's just not true that there are two classes of humanity the drunks and the drug addicts who had terrible parents and those of us who are sober and self-disciplined because we had good parents okay there are millions of us untold millions who had terrible parents and with traumatic experiences whether as children or as adults who live a sober self-disciplined life all right the difference between the sober and the drunk is not a binary matter of whether or not we have emotional problems the difference is in how we cope with those emotional problems the difference frankly is in the progress we make we're all born stupid we're all born ignorant we're all born selfish but we're also born curious we're also born ambitious and the drugs and alcohol snuff that curiosity and ambition out tana i sympathize with your story about how terrible your childhood was i sympathized your story about what terrible parents you had i sympathize more than you could possibly know but there's another question here which is why aren't you over it yet why didn't you deal with this in the last five years and my answer is for you it's because of the drugs and alcohol some of you will say that i'm wrong you'll look at someone like tana mongeau and say she has a wonderful life she's a great success story you look at someone like the amazing atheist or ali hardesty and say what an amazing life what a success story when you look back at just the last five years leading up to this point what you have to recognize is there is a better person that they could be today if they have been sober during the last five years and that better person now will never exist there's a kind of potential there that's been snuffed out and that is the sense in which the drug addicts who live in fancy mansions and sleep on four poster beds are exactly the same as the drug addicts who are sleeping on the street tonight every single one of them had a mother and a father some of them went to school with you some of them had at some stage the same intellectual potential that you've got now everything that a family like instills there was never like that reliability again everything i feel like i am is because i was making up for what they like weren't you know what i mean like they were so shitty and they were abusive and they were you know they treated me bad and i was like i don't want to be that i want to treat people well i want to like because i'm a very productive person i like to get up i like to start my days i like to be productive and for the most part just not really me not really my thing like i said i like to be productive that's why i smoke crack no i'm just kidding but really yeah i was gonna say this is one of the only times i ever did acid but that's just not true so i won't mind you i'll save you that time but this was my first time taking like real acid on my tongue like full tab like let's go baby i hate drugs and i believe this country would do better if everyone would stop smoking marijuana and doing all these drugs i am very sorry for what i did and i have to live with it every day and that if i were to get a second chance i would do everything my power to try to help others the way they raised me wasn't it they just neglected me in like a lot of ways i definitely didn't get like proper health care proper food proper schooling proper love proper nurturing proper schedule but it's cool to see you like like to rise from that yeah push through that well i wanted to help like kids who like you know what i mean but i try to push through because i know that's what you guys would want me to do and i hope you give me a chance to try to help others i wanted to help like kids who like you know what i mean like maybe they didn't have the best home yeah if i believe it's your decision to decide where i go whether i live or die because that's like that's the reality of it all you know we're not always all raised by like perfect families and sometimes we just have to you know pick [ __ ] up and raise ourselves the role that drugs and alcohol play in our life is complex but in a sense the significance of sobriety in our life is far more complex far more profound living with a kind of curiosity and ambition to learn more be more all the time and never turning it off all right that leads to emotional intellectual and ethical progress in all kinds of ways that again you can't reduce to a simple mathematical formula on the chalkboard it's hard to look at the amazing atheist or ali hardesty and feel like this person wasn't always doomed to turn out to be a brainless scumbag they had the same kind of intellectual potential i do and it's even harder when you're looking at a homeless drug addict on the street okay i have so many older brothers guys who have a fair bit of dna in common with me and i think those guys were born with the same intellectual potential i had or to turn it around they were born just as stupid as i was you know i wasn't born any less stupid than they were either okay but they made the wrong choices they got drugs and alcohol involved in their lives and so like tana mongeau there's a sense in which they never made progress and guess what my brothers and i were all dealing with the same bad parents we're dealing with the same bad culture the same bad school system the same bad political context the same bad upbringing in so many ways you can guess i'm not close with any of my brothers these are guys i talk to once every five years or once every 10 years but you know what i can see with every single one of them five years go by and they haven't learned a goddamn thing they haven't made any progress no not intellectually not in terms of like research but also not emotionally they've got baggage they've been carrying around with themselves since childhood they've never learned to take a more philosophical attitude towards they've never questioned it they've never analyzed it they've never investigated they never learned to put it down one of my brothers you know he hated me from the day i was born and i've been in situations where he walks into the room and there are a bunch of other people and everyone can feel it everyone picks up on the tension once just once i sat down to talk to him about why does he feel this way what does he think and the stuff he told me it falls apart after five seconds of analysis or introspection he tells me oh well you went to a better university than i did really i went to the university of toronto you went to the university of ottawa i could see you that you went to a better university than i did in in my area of study and in his area of study in terms of what our actual majors were and i thought what do you mean i applied to go to your university i'm visiting i know it's a good universe what are you saying to me these universities are equal or actually your university is slightly better in our fields right he had he had a better education than me he ended up with a master's degree i only have an honors pa you know immediately he shifts onto claiming that i went to a better primary school that i went to a better high school team we sit down and talk about it for five minutes it's a fantasy he constructed in his mind he probably constructed his mind when he was still a little boy or a teenager he had constructed this fantasy that had this amazing life of privilege he never once asked anyone he never once asked me what kind of school i went to and as soon as we start talking about it guess what it turns out that you know he went to better schools than i did at every stage of his education this kind of jealousy this kind of envy this kind of sibling rivalry it's not extraordinary it's not rare it's dismally common what's uncommon is my brother's failure to cope with it his failure to question it his failure to ever think these things through and ultimately over the passage of years his inability to ever get over it and yes what i'm telling you is drugs and alcohol played a crucial role in this way in perpetuating his emotional problems what youtube shows us again and again is young brilliant people bristling with potential and then their total lack of intellectual development as soon as they have just a little bit of money and fame coming in through this platform and yeah in most of these cases the crucial undisclosed factor is drug addiction whether or not it's perceived as an addiction it's the role that drugs and alcohol play in snuffing out their curiosity in smothering their ambition and making them incapable of the kind of emotional progress the kind of overcoming of our emotional problems that sober people are doing all the time even when we don't particularly try my sling is editorial explicit material briefcase show lava stereo flow fill

short-lived government of the 30 tyrants was socrates complicit were his students and colleagues complicit in our century socrates has become a powerful cultural symbol but what exactly does he symbolize you could say that in france napoleon bonaparte is a powerful symbol you could say that in the united states of america george washington is a powerful symbol but if you ask people why what meaning does this symbol have why is this so important to people who can tell you with any certainty with any self-confidence what the philosophy of napoleon bonaparte was or why it still matters to this day who can speak at any length or any depth about what george washington means to them personally or even politically in the simplest sense of the term people live with a cartoonish notion of who socrates was who plato was or why they ever mattered if these cartoonish notions were true they wouldn't matter at all socrates was a political dissident socrates was a religious dissident and it got him killed and that is why his story still matters very few people and very few university professors treat this subject with the seriousness it deserves in our generation people seem to care very little what the historical significance of napoleon was what his philosophy was of what is political significance was we treat him as a malleable symbol of greatness as a sort of anonymized faceless all-purpose placeholder for the great man whether we're using him as a pawn in presenting french nationalism or perhaps presenting the clash between modernity and medieval traditionalism it's a very strange recklessness we have in looking back at history and taking bits and pieces of it and liberally reinterpreting it and applying it however seems convenient for our own political interests at this moment in time and then isn't there an interesting change in tone when we look at a phenomenon like jordan peterson's very loose very liberal reinterpretation of the historical significance of adolf hitler suddenly we become uncomfortable suddenly we start to insist that the facts of history must matter that deceased historical figures are not merely play things to be deployed in any way that might be politically convenient for us today there can be no doubt the single greatest source of influence and the single greatest source of bias in the reinterpretation and retelling of the myth of socrates has been the christian bible has been the mythological figure of jesus christ if you've had the misfortune of studying philosophy at a western university in all likelihood your professors did not consciously think that they were going to misinterpret or misrepresent socrates so that his story resembled that of jesus as much as possible but very much the framing and presentation of the story of his trial his death his execution it is presented as one of martyrdom martyrdom to a philosophy yes martyrdom to a very different conception of god there's tremendous emphasis placed on this notion that socrates was faultless and blameless not as an intellectual dissident not as a religious dissident not as someone who was part of a political conspiracy to transform the society he was a part of but instead he is represented as a sacrificial lamb the trial and execution of socrates took place in the context of a wave of reprisal killings people were being killed to get even for atrocities committed by the short-lived government of the 30 tyrants at that time in athens people were going to court trying to sue one another trying to get money from one another and trying to kill each other over the question of who was complicit in the government of the 30 tyrants was socrates complicit were his students and colleagues complicit an author named lysius provides compelling primary source evidence of court cases of this kind i am saying primary source because these are not later reflections on the court cases these are actually speeches that were written by lysius to be presented in court these documents or these affidavits i could say show people trying to defend themselves against the accusation that they were complicit in the rule of the thirty tyrants and they also show the opposite they show allegations and denunciations being made connecting people to the 30 tyrants socrates was not the only man being forced to drink hemlock in athens people were being persecuted people were being questioned people were being cross-examined about what side they had been on in the tumultuous period of athens reverting from democracy to aristocracy and then fighting a bitter civil war to re-establish democracy thereafter if you take a moment to pause and read the text on screen here and indeed the slide just before that i've shown you you will get a sense of just how intense and just how passionate these courtroom battles were people wanted one way or another to get even and as you will learn in this brief video the people they were trying to get even with were precisely socrates and his students my point here is not to portray socrates as a revolutionary certainly he was not a revolutionary leader in the sense that george washington was he was also not a revolutionary leader in the sense that robespierre was or napoleon bonaparte was no but it is completely ridiculous to think of socrates as a christ-like figure what would anyone say about jesus christ if his disciples had participated in a coup d'etat if they had come into power and destroyed democracy by colluding with a foreign army in the same way that the students of socrates were able to effectively collude with the spartans to take over the government of athens this is not some minor footnote in the history of philosophy and it is certainly not a minor footnote in the political history of athens it is a momentous tremendous event that implicates socrates plato xenophon all of the famous names on this list in the 50 years leading up to the death of socrates there can be no doubt that the single most powerful most influential and important political figure was pericles in the text that we have socrates was an incredibly harsh critic of pericles and yet simultaneously he was the closest companion of alcabiatis and alcibiades was adopted by pericles legally speaking he was raised by pericles as his son he was groomed to be a major political leader and indeed he would go on to become a major political leader he was prepared to be a major military leader and in the 25 years or so of combat with sparta alcabiatis would indeed be a tremendously important military leader as well however at this time in just the last few years leading up to the death of socrates alcabiatis had become intensely hated and in the records that we have of court cases preserved by lysius we can see that the name and reputation of alcabiatis is being used to dam and condemn people to be a close associate of alcabiatis would be enough to get you killed in the period of reprisals following after the short-lived tyranny of the thirty now the relationship between socrates and democracy is complicated the relationship between al qaeda's and democracy is complicated but at this time politically it was not perceived as complicated we have here a quotation from a court case concerning the son of alcabiatis a son who had the same first name and you can see that in court it is being stated that if any of you gentlemen of the jury if any of you resent the government of the thirty tyrants you should blame this man because his father was the cause of all this now i would not say to you anything so simplistic as to claim that alcabiatis personally was responsible for the government of the thirty tyrants but this is the way it was perceived this was a time at which having your name closely associated with alcabiatis could politically entail your ruin it could even entail your trial and death now tell me who was more closely associated with alcabiatis than socrates the elephant in the room here is pedophilia the elephant in the room here is what we call pederasty in ancient athens it is very clear from a notorious text written by plato called plato's symposium that socrates and alcabiatis were commonly perceived to be gay lovers to have a homosexual relationship and this was around the time when al-qaeda's was 20 years of age allegedly that text although about the first half of it might as well be a manifesto for pedophiles the conclusion where we actually hear the perspective of alka biatis himself and of socrates himself it specifies that they had what we would now call a platonic relationship that in fact they were not gay lovers but they lived in a culture that was accepting of this peculiar kind of age-gap relationship to such an extent that the close relationship socrates and alcubiadis had was perceived as what we might now call a gay marriage the name of alcubiadis has not remained famous in the same way that the name of plato has down to this day he is however a somewhat romanticized figure at least amongst people with phds because he was the student of the philosophy of socrates who went on to have a spectacular military career a spectacular political career even if it was a career that was largely disastrous and ended with spectacular failure the next two names on this list have been utterly forgotten kritius and theramenis at that time these would have been the most famous the most infamous the most notorious people in athens because they had been disciples of socrates and they went on to become the founders of and the leaders of the government of 30 tyrants at first criteus and theriminis shared the same views and were personal friends but when criteus acting as one who had himself been exiled by the democracy began to show this lust for putting people to death theramenis opposed him there is no sense he said in putting a man to death simply because he has been honored by the democracy and when he has done the aristocracy no harm at all at this stage criteus was still on friendly terms of ceremonies it is he said quite impossible for those who want to gain power to avoid getting rid of those people who are most likely to form an opposition to it and it is pure simplicity on your part if you think that just because we are 30 and not one we have to keep a less close watch on the government than is done by an absolute dictator so more and more people were put to death and put to death unjustly these names may not be famous now but if you had been alive at that time if you had been a citizen of athens who participated in the trial and execution of socrates these names would have seemed very famous indeed criteus and theriminis were disciples of socrates they were close friends with both socrates and plato and they had colluded with an enemy army they had colluded with the army of sparta to carry out a coup d'etat to create a new system of government in which the two of them sat at the top the two of them were the most powerful dictators or the most powerful demagogues the two of them killed others and then after they had a falling out they turned against each other and critias killed thereminis quote when the attendants came forward and were dragging him off therimenes bore his bad fortune with a noble spirit since indeed he had no little acquaintance with philosophy in company with socrates the multitude however in general mourned the ill fortune of thereminis but had not the courage to come to his aid since a strong armed guard stood around him now socrates the philosopher and two of his intimates ran forward and endeavored to hinder the attendance but theramenis entreated them to do nothing of the kind he appreciated he said their friendship and bravery but as for himself it would be the greatest grief if he should be the cause of the death of those who were so intimately associated with him socrates and his helpers since they had no aid from anyone else and saw the intransigence of those in authority increasing made no move then those who had received their orders dragged ceremonies from the altar and hustled him through the center of the marketplace to his execution and the populace terror stricken at the arms of the garrison the garrison of spartan soldiers i might add were filled with pity for the unfortunate man and shed tears not only over his fate but also over their own slavery for all the common sort when they saw a man of such virtuous ceremonies treated with such contumely had concluded that they in their weakness would be sacrificed without a thought the most basic problem with this passage politically is that it has socrates and his followers in the same room with ceremonies and criteus this is very much depicting socrates plato and his followers his followers including the two men who were dictators at this time ceremonies and criticism it's depicting them as all being on the same side and inside this government that so soon became hated for its corruption and brutality this regime that was torn down by a pro-democratic revolution a pro-democratic revolution that socrates plato etc were all on the wrong side of plato goes on living for a long time after socrates and most of the other names in that list so naturally he had to create some kind of deeply dishonest justification for what his role in this notorious dictatorship was nevertheless even in clearing his name he implicates himself he implicates socrates and he further illustrates for us the context within which as i say socrates must die quote the existing constitution democracy being generally condemned a revolution took place and there were appointed rulers with full powers over public affairs as a whole some of these were relatives and acquaintances of mine they at once invited me to share in their doings as something to which i had a claim the effect on me was not surprising in the case of a young man i considered that they would of course so manage the state as to bring men out of a bad way of life into a good one so i watched them very closely to see what they would do and seeing as i did that in quite a short time they made the former government democracy seemed by comparison something as precious as gold dot dot dot close quote the problem with this passage politically is that plato is admitting to you that he and his friends and relatives were indeed members of the dictatorship of the 30 from the start that he himself was indeed part of this pro-aristocratic anti-democratic conspiracy plato is a profoundly biased source plato is trying to save his own skin plato is trying in some ways to protect the reputation of socrates in retrospect xenophon is a profoundly biased source he is engaged in the glorification of socrates and to some extent he's trying to rationalize politically what sparta did he was in the strange position of being an athenian who switched sides and started fighting for sparta it is only in those primary source texts preserved by lysius that we get a sense of just how nasty the political circumstances really were and the depth of hatred that was directed towards socrates himself and his followers in athens at that time and we get a sense of the extent to which that hatred was well earned it was deserved plato wasn't just defending his reputation for no reason at all both thereminis and criteus were disciples of socrates and keep in mind the name of criteus even appears in the dialogues of plato that were written to glorify socrates although the short quotation i read you from xenophon a minute ago makes it seem as if theramentes had the most pious of intentions in carrying out this coup d'etat making himself a dictator and destroying democracy whereas kritius was really the bad guy if you take a moment to read this quotation from a court case from lysius you will instead have the sense that there are many should not be glorified for having been killed by the system of government he created himself he should instead be blamed for his collusion with the spartans his conspiracy with an enemy army to bring about the creation of that terrible new form of government in the first place a form of government that again plato and socrates were both involved in they were both implicated in but plato at least later admitted was an absolutely terrible system of government a government so bad that looking back at it now it makes democracy seem better by comparison when we evaluate socrates and his disciples as political leaders in their political context how many of these men were pro-spartan or how many of them appeared to be how many of these men were pro-oligarchy or how many of them appeared to be and conversely how many of them can be simply and unironically said to be pro-democracy how many of them were fighting against oligarchy against elitism against the aristocracy taking their stand with the common people who wanted democracy and wanted to kick the spartans out there seems to be a very loosely organized conspiracy of professors and people with phds that prevents these questions from ever being asked some of you may be shocked or you may pretend to be shocked and my assertion that we have to evaluate socrates as a political leader and we have to evaluate his students as political leaders some of you may be burdened with this misconception that socrates only went around preaching personal virtue private morality that he wasn't a political dissident at all that he wasn't a religious dissonant at all that he wasn't trying to change the society he was a part of and that he wasn't trying to take over the government well if you feel that way it probably reflects the selected readings you were assigned from within the extant corpus of texts i would direct you to two very large very long very boring attacks written by plato himself the gorgius and first alcabiatis here we see very clearly that socrates does think of himself as a politician that he does think of himself as a statesman that he does think of himself as a dissident political leader and that he says directly to al qaeda's the adopted son of pericles that he socrates is now the only true political leader athens has and that in effect alchemiadi should follow him alcubia should take on his philosophy as part and parcel of his own peculiar path to power it is very clear in the gorgeous and first alcabiatis that socrates wasn't just friends with the conspirators who happened to take over the leadership of the government he had his own political agenda i said before that he could be condemned to death just for being in the room when some of those decisions were made by the government of the 30 tyrants well if you're willing to read these texts with open eyes and an open mind and an open heart i think you'll inevitably come to the conclusion that he was in that room for a reason socrates was not just a passive observer of politics in his times he was an active participant although the figures who wrote the history or at least some of them like xenophon and plato were trying to rescue his reputation from the disaster that was the government of the thirty tyrants a government created by and ruled by two of socrates's own students a government that both socrates and plato participated in even if they would later come to regret it and to try to portray themselves as instead the friends of democracy a game that was played by alcabiatis again and again until frankly he had used up all of his credibility and had become hated by both his allies and his enemies alike i do not celebrate christmas starting in the winter of 2018 i created this alternative holiday called sock mess because fundamentally i felt embarrassed to involve my own daughter in the celebration of christmas in the recitation again and again of what i fundamentally think is a meaningless if not pernicious story about this mythological figure jesus christ however you will have figured out by now if you've been watching this video from beginning to end i do not really look up to socrates as my personal hero i certainly do not regard him as a christ-like idealized mythological figure nor am i interested in creating a new mythology to glorify him i think we live in a culture where so many of the stories we recite as we put our children to bed or as they sit in front of the television are frankly meaningless not this one the story of socrates it's meaningful there's so much we can learn from it there's so many different angles from which it can be analyzed and there's something really worth explaining really worth reflecting on there for the next generation even if you conclude that socrates is more of a villain than he is a hero if any of you in the audience today want to influence the future of your parliamentary democracy the best method you've got at your disposal is probably to start recording youtube videos or perhaps writing letters to the editor that will be published in the local newspaper for men like socrates and his closest followers including al qaeda's including chris taking over the leadership of the government was a very real option and in the case of alcubiatis and in the case of criteus they didn't just talk about doing it for a short time they did it just as thucydides had warned the people of athens thought of themselves as living in a democracy but in fact they lived in a city that was at any one time ruled by just one man by its most preeminent citizen by whatever demagogue was best able to move the crowd socrates was a man of his times he did not transcend them he lived in a society that genuinely had direct democracy and we don't and it's that contrast that makes all of these things so important for us to reflect on now as we evaluate what the future of modern western parliamentary democracy should be who was going to be the next pericles quite possibly algae biatis quite possibly socrates himself they lived in a society where any well-spoken well-educated man could stand up at the penins could stand up in the public forum and quite rapidly find himself in a position of real political power and real military power however he did so at every stage at the risk of his own life in this video i've repeatedly quoted for you legal texts written by lysius there's one text i didn't quote that gives a tremendously bleak and realistic look at political conditions in athens at that time when it reflects ladies and gentlemen of the jury it was all gentlemen i confess gentlemen of the jury we've just lived through a period of time where everybody had changed sides two three four times we've known people who used to support the democracy but then as soon as their own interest was at stake as soon as it was their own family or they had some way to profit they started supporting the aristocracy we've known other people who had an earlier phase were part of a pro-aristocratic coup d'etat and then later they fought and died heroically in a pro-democratic revolution the whole city of athens knew what it was like to live through a period of tumult of chaos of death of war yes but also of tremendous opportunity this kind of opportunity frankly corrupted socrates it corrupted plato it corrupted xenophon alcabiatis chris and the rest and it corrupted them in a way that they were not even fully aware of themselves they were corrupted by the very real possibility of holding in their own hands political power and we all of us in this audience right now we've lived our whole lives without ever knowing that kind of temptation instead we live with the depressing acceptance of the fact that whatever we may say whatever we may write really will never make a difference in the world whereas in that society with direct democracy whatever they might stand up and say could have real consequences of life and death for themselves and others i'm gonna ask you to take a moment and share the link to this video with someone else who could stand to learn something from it because before a few weeks ago i had never heard of deodoris i had never heard of lysius i had never heard of the seventh epistle of plato the primary sources are kind of hidden in plain sight we live in a culture where people who have university education are more ignorant about these things than those who lack it because we mostly learn about socrates we mostly learn about plato through the university reader a selection of short passages that makes you feel that you've read plato makes you feel that you know plato when you haven't read the gorgeous you haven't read the first documentaries you haven't read any of the sources we've quoted in this video you've become familiar with a few block quotations from the republic a few carefully selected extracts of text that knowingly or unknowingly serve the professor's political agenda and this is the alternative we can take socrates back from academia we can present our children with something more meaningful than christmas more meaningful than batman and x-men and supermen but something more meaningful than what we encountered at elite levels of education ourselves [Music] maybe we can we can practice"},{"id":"YrfuamQLlsM","text":"youtube is this remarkably malleable art form and whether you think of it as a hobby or as a career and i mean this this video is really addressed to people who make the commitment that they want it to be their career they want to succeed and admitting that to yourself is difficult and then really thinking through philosophically and pragmatically what are you willing to do to make it happen so if that's what you want if you if that's what you want is is to succeed now what are you willing to do to make it happen i know a youtube channel who i gave completely unsolicited advice to a youtube channel that does vegan food videos and she had the honesty to come out and admit with some anguish and frustration on camera that what she really wanted was for youtube to take over her life where she wouldn't have any other job for to become her career for her to be making videos on such a scale that you know it's it's all the money she needs in this life and along with that comes fame and other things well you know she makes videos about food what are you willing to do to get it i mean like you know you really want to make videos that are going to bring in tens of thousands of views hundreds of thousands of views have you even really thought that through now i'll come back to that example i the point of this video ultimately is to talk about the stuff i normally don't talk about because it's not what i'm doing myself that's not the kind of success i'm i'm pursuing myself but if admitting that you want it admitting that that's what you try to do is one thing and then thinking strategically about you know your mission your mandate aesthetically in terms of the the container and then also thinking about the content what it is you're going to do to succeed in that way i think that most people really can't be honest themselves not even at that first step one of the most important pieces of advice i give people that i'm giving you right now is to think about how happy you'll be if you get on this path and it ends in failure there are all kinds of things that in your mind's eye seem like they're worth doing if you presume that you will be a success but is it worth doing if it ends in failure or if there's a succession of failures along the way before whatever measure of success it is that you managed to ring out of it i remember meeting people who were getting a phd in anthropology at all phases and stages of that career path and many of them had it fixed in their mind's eye that they would be the lucky minority to go on to get a highly paid highly celebrated position as a published famous anthropologist now that phrase may seem laughable in itself to many of you in the honest a famous anthropologist what does that mean in every generation there are a few there are a few famous anthropologists but how many people with phd's anthropology end up teaching english as a second language in japan how many of them end up teaching there's a second language in taiwan thailand laos you and the various places i met them and i knew one guy with a phd in anthropology uh who ended up getting a job working in the the back of a kitchen as a fry cook and helping to train the other staff then i remember he went on to uh he went on to work in a wine shop selling bottles of wine over the counter now look if you love anthropology if you love reading about anthropology if you love writing about anthropology if this is really part of the meaning of life for you and you're willing to do it anyway you know if you're willing to you're willing to publish a book and you feel that researching and writing and publishing that book about anthropology is worthwhile even if nobody else reads it even if nobody else appreciates it you know i mean there are some people who have that level of commitment to anthropology and i'm going to be real with you i think when i was working as an editor i used to work in the publishing industry i think some of my clients were like that some of the authors whose books i was helping to publish these were these were written by people who had they had no hope that anyone would ever read their book they had no hope of ever getting ahead as a in a career and never being a professor but they were really committed to anthropology they felt that this was worth doing even if it ended in failure or forget the ending in the end we're all dead after all you know sooner or later you die of old age no matter what you specialize in but they for them was worthwhile to fail again and again and again and to keep on failing for them anthropology was worth doing even if it were a failure the vast majority of people who make that decision who make that commitment who decide to spend tens of thousands of dollars in some cases it's it's more than a hundred thousand dollars like getting a master's degree and a phd it can be a lot of money you know uh and to spend many of the best years of their life struggling and suffering and not doing innumerable other things just to get that certification in in anthropology the vast majority of the people i've met uh they have the delusion that they will go on to be the one in a million they will they will be what's a good comparison here in stand-up comedy they will be the equivalent of what who's the famous standard comedian right now they will be the next kevin hart what kevin hart is to stand up comedy if you go into stand-up comedy it's an equally good example and you're going to put in the time and the hours and the effort and suffer the humiliation and suffer the failure have the audience not laugh at your jokes again and again go to open mic nights and try your material and once in a while you get a good joke like you have a bad set there are a couple good jokes and then someone else steals your jokes you get to live through that you have to live through all the shame and humiliation of failure again and again and again well if that process is worthwhile for you if you're motivated not motivated to succeed but you're motivated to fail that it's worth failing then standing up comedy is worth doing then anthropology is worth doing dennis the right then that's the right path for you and in a sense if you succeed that that won't really matter like if you're incorruptable if you're corruptable success will corrupt you the money and the fame and success will corrupt you of course but if you're incorruptable it won't matter you'll be in a position to say that as an anthropologist or as a comedian you're doing exactly the same thing that you uh you would be doing you're doing exactly the same thing you'd do um if there if nobody was watching if nobody were laughing you know if as a stand-up comedy comedian if no one were reading your book now here's the thing about youtube youtube is this unbelievably malleable uh medium right like the first two examples they're really quite narrow what do you want to do in anthropology anthropology is based on so-called participant observation and you could write up a monograph you know what i mean i'm gonna imagine wouldn't it be great to have a monograph about what was going on with the ojibwe of um the upper peninsula of michigan during the bill clinton years reflecting eight years of field work eight years of research that's anthropology you go out you live with people you listen to them like ideally you don't even ask them questions ideally you don't even ask them what they think about policy you just listen to them when they talk about politics you know you note things down and you do some kind of analysis who's who's going to care you will you can you know but the problem is most people they have attachment to outcomes that it's not that the outcomes are impossible it's not even that they're improbable it is in a sense that those outcomes can't be earned the point is not that you can't succeed the point is not that nobody succeeds the point is not that failure is inevitable the point is not even that success is improbable the point is not that it's that it's one in a million the point is that the difference between success and failure is something you cannot earn right and i mean everyone knows this if what you're chasing is fame and a big audience you know the most the most ridiculous circumstance could happen that makes you famous on the internet you get into a fight with a waitress and a famous person who happens to be in the restaurant at the same time as you throws their drink at you and all of a sudden you're you know a million people are interested some complete nonsense like this can catapult you to fame whereas the diligence and hard work to create a really great album as a rapper uh to create a really great set as a stand-up comedian to do something really worthwhile right or to put in the time necessary to be a youtuber or the time necessary to be an anthropologist right you can't earn that further outcome so you have to commit to you know your own creative role your involvement in the art form in a way where you are going to be happy where it is going to be meaningful to you even if it's a failure so knowing that you know um well what kind of rap album do you want to make how is this going to affect your rap music once you kind of not it's not that you've let go of the process it's not that you've let go of the product like you still care about quality you still care about doing the best you can and make making a great rapper making an album that's better than the rap songs that are in the top 10 whatever okay but what do you what do you want to rap about what is going to be the content of this now i would suggest to you naively that probably you not a general you the actual specific human being in the audience listening probably you would say that you want to make an album singing about or rapping about something that's really meaningful to you something where it's really going to be worth it for you to put in all this effort if it never makes you 100 if it's never successful and where if you're listening to it again again i mean what if you have to perform the song live 100 times you aren't getting sick of it you don't regard it as shallow right where there's something about it where you feel you're doing something uniquely valuable now what if i said to you hey that's a terrible idea how about instead you listen to the songs that are currently on the top 10 for rap you make a new song which is like an average of the lyrics in the top 10 rap songs so you know like you go through verse by verse you're like okay so five of them talk about being a drug dealer five of them talk about pimping well you know you go through you you isolate it thematically and what the raps are yeah um uh conflict with the police conflict with your own parents like take out the different kind of stereotype things okay oh okay no they also rap about how expensive their shoes are you know how they have a better gold watch than a famous basketball player you could go through image by image of mine and you could create a rap song that is indistinguishable from its competition how are you going to feel with that now most people most young people but let's be real most middle-aged people also they will think about this as if success is a foregone conclusion they'll say oh a little it's going to be great they're going to be so happy once this is a hit rap song and once they have you know millions of fans and huge amounts of money oh they they have no problem with their own lack of originality given the presumption of success and success on a massive scale success in a way that's gonna that's gonna change their lives okay okay okay okay but how are you gonna feel if you're committed to this this idea that if you're gonna do this you have to be comfortable with failure it has to be worthwhile for you as a process and as a product if you fail again and again and again now what so i think what's paradoxical about this is that the presumption of failure or embracing failure actually results in you raising your own standards it results in you increasing your expectations of yourself and saying okay then i don't want to do the same thing everyone else is doing because i'm not going to make any money out of it i'm not going to get famous doing it i have to actually do this for for the sake of the art itself or for the sake of the message itself or for me for me myself i have to do this for me i think what a lot of people are addicted to is the idea of effortless success the an end and let's be clear youtube gives you a remarkable number of examples of effortlessly successful people um you may think that you can just come on camera and talk about your own life the way trisha paytas did so i think trisha paytas goes back more than eight years more than 10 years maybe 15 years now on this platform and that you can for example be a fat self-pitying uh former stripper who comes on camera and breaks down weeping about your breakup with your ex-boyfriend breaks down weeping about your struggles to lose weight and how you never lose weight she breaks down weeping with a misery in her life that you can be a fat sobbing fool on camera that's what trisha paytas did and you will be elevated to success just like treasure buddies no game plan no strategy where you don't think of it as filmmaking you don't think it was any effort now look the the problem with youtube is that you can't learn from success right success on youtube is self-instantiating these instances like present themselves and the easiest examples to see well why don't you come up with an arithmetic estimate for me of how many fat self-pitying middle-aged people come on youtube and talk about breaking up with women and they never get 100 views they're never gonna and how many of them did it fifteen years ago one treasure because you can you can say usually oh well she was here at the beginning yeah there were a lot of those channels have been deleted like a lot of the evidence has disappeared most of them didn't keep their channels up but you know what there were a lot of people coming on and talking about their lives autobiographically and again ultimately it can't be about the odds it's not about a gamble it's not about rolling the dice and seeing who wins seeing who gets to be the next trisha paytas because the investment of time and energy you're making is a hundred percent certain it's only the outcome that's uncertain right so regarding it as a gamble is misleading learning from success is very difficult especially if you don't know people face to face they don't really talk you through what they went through and and how they how they succeeded and where their money comes from i used to work in the publishing industry and there were a lot of really weird publications for editors and publishers they're kind of publications they're not secret but they're only read by people who are who are inside the industry and i can remember reading articles talking about the fact from different angles people have this assumption that you're getting rich from books like whether you're the editor or the author or whatever and people do show up at these uh conventions in the publishing industry they're different kind of book events and they may show up driving a ferrari or a lamborghini or something and people think oh you know that's because he published his book or oh that's because he is an editor or a book publisher he's making all this this money out of out of books it's like no this guy inherited several million dollars from his parents and then decided to go into the book publishing industry as a kind of charity and this applies to the authors also so i mean anything like this this is a simple example but boy is it is it deep i mean you know there are so many people on instagram today i heard about one in specific from a specific youtuber she was talking about her ex-boyfriend there are people who photograph themselves leaning on an expensive car with a woman in a bikini and the illusion the audience has is that this guy owns this expensive car because of the money he's making out of instagram itself regardless of the extent to which you know the model is paid for and the car is a rental you know those things aside um you know what is success and where does the money come from and to what extent is your own position uh bought or paid for what the public regards as an asset can really be a liability if you don't know people face to face if you don't work with people face to face it's very hard to learn from other success and you may you may end up imitating the aspects of their business model that are liabilities you know and not not the real source of their of their success so james newman says that there are so many videos on youtube from authors talking about how poorly paid they are uh yes i can send um i could send a link on that but i have to go dig through my my email there are websites that collect together the complaints from successful journalists about exactly how little they got paid to do a feature story in rolling stone and it'll list the amount of money they got paid the number of months of work they did the number of pages of text it was like how much how much time went into the research how much time went to the writing how many pages was and then it's like and then rolling stone paid me 400 us dollars um so you know i'm using rolling stone as an example that's one that sticks in my mind it's so that authors can compare notes with one another and say well look i only got paid two hundred dollars what did you get paid and these people are already in the incredibly uh privileged cast of of being able to publish and get and get paid for it at all i remember a particular article and i think in this case it was in the guardian but maybe maybe it was in publishers weekly or new york new york review of books or something because i used to read some weird publications connected to the potions a woman describe a certain hit author uh he was at the one of the book launch events uh launching one of his books and there were many people at the event who were in the know that this guy was basically born a european aristocrat like his parents owned a castle you know we had to get money this way and he got a question from the audience which was completely sincere and the person still says hey look i'm a fan of your books you know this is the third book of yours i've read and i love but tell me you know i i see you know you have a wife and kids and you know you're a little so what i don't understand is how could someone like you devote your time to writing this kind of philosophical stuff with no other no other job or career the guy gave an answer which was 100 insincere he stood there and said yes it's very difficult but you know i have to supplement my income by also placing uh short articles in newspapers and magazines and so the woman writing the article that i was reading she said there was a very telling laugh and it was laughter that didn't come from one part of the audience but here and there throughout the audience there were enough people who knew what this guy's real financial situation was and the reality that this was you know an aristocrats hobby he didn't rely on his books for money at all and that indeed every stage of his career including at least initially publishing his first or second book was directly paid for many authors now launch their careers by paying you know they pay the publisher to print and publish the book so the book itself is is money losing for the author not not money making the point is there is a problem here with strength being misperceived as weakness and weakness being misproceeded as strength and it is very very hard to learn from successful examples if you don't actually know those successful people if you can't actually listen to them and talk to them and see ideally you participate in the process and you really understand how their business works as well as really understanding uh how their art works uh this video is addressed to people and it may be none of you in the audience you know it may be none of the particular people with science right now but it's addressed to people who've admitted to themselves that they want youtube to be their only career that ideally they'd make a transition from this being a hobby to being there to being their sole source of income so the question and actually you do to ask joke about that and again many of these kind of reflections they apply to many many other lines of work many other i don't know many other interests in life whether they're research interests career interests educational interests or what have you i you know my girlfriend and i we read a lot of literature from ancient greece in rome within the last four and a half years we have had a lot of stuff we've been reading from ancient athens in rome i think melissa i think you're also impressed now by looking at appian i know you haven't had that much time with it so you know really we first did athens but lately we've also read so from it would be quite a decision to make that your career to say hey i don't want to do this as a hobby i want to make reading and talking about ancient roman literature in latin i want to be and could do it i could do it too look let's not be humble i also could compared to other languages of study you know latin would be incredibly easy uh no offense what a leap and what a thing to admit to yourself now we've already brought into this conversation the other kind of philosophical question which is okay if you want to do this you want to do ancient latin and or ancient greek okay and you want that to be are you going to be happy with yourself if you fail if you commit to this you give it 110 and i don't just mean that you fail in the end you fail in the process you fail again and again and again you know now maybe it's worth it maybe it's going to be great maybe you can really feel good about yourself and you say you're going to get a part-time job working at arby's i don't know does rb's exist in europe maybe i should use a less specific cultural example i don't know you're going to get yourself a part-time job as a librarian there's something more vegan you're going to get yourself a part-time job as librarian you're gonna put all your time and energy into studying latin and greek and maybe publishing your own additions and writing your own research and coming on youtube and talking about what you're doing you are gonna do this and even if nobody ever cares and you never earn any money out of it still you know this is worth it to you right you you you love it enough that it's going to be worth it to you okay you know so so that works right if you're if you're committed to it where you're not just committed to success you're willing to make the commitment you're willing to put in the effort even if it ends in failure or even if it's a failure at every stage okay so now you've got the winning formula like there's a sense in which you can't lose because even if you lose you're when you win because you're going to be so happy with yourself and so happy with your life that you managed to learn latin or you managed to learn ancient greek and you managed to do this research and publish these studies and come on youtube and share that with a few dozen people who care whatever if you can be happy failing okay you've gotta you've got a working model have you ever known someone who decided to become a bodybuilder and uh come on youtube and talk about weight loss and fitness and they never get more than 500 viewers do you know anyone like that i know a lot of people like okay okay the problem is in terms of the content you're doing in terms of the choices you're making right is it going to be worth it to you to sacrifice your whole life to going to the gym and eating that regimented diet and photographing yourself in that bikini or if you're a dude photographing yourself in those bikini bottoms you know whatever you know what i'm saying and and paying for the waxing and paying for the laser hair removal okay and all the work you're putting into your appearance and your health and fitness to come on youtube and give a message and again before i talked about being a rapper where your rap lyrics are like an average of 10 other rappers rap lyrics right you are probably giving health advice that could be generated as the average of 10 other bodybuilding youtube channels right like i can take those put them into a computer and get the average and you're saying something that approximates what 10 other youtube channels said right and you are devoting all of your time and energy that and you probably made that commitment or made that decision with success as a foregone conclusion and you didn't think about how meaningful is this going to be from how rewarding is it going to be for me if i fail if you know anyone who is an aspiring youtuber aspiring professional youtuber share the link share the link with them i'd be nice to have someone here is actually in the struggle but as i say a lot of these reflections are meaningful to every other every other kind of struggle [Music] you"},{"id":"ZcuIfCkWc6U","text":"it's easy to give advice on the internet because you as the broadcaster do not have to live with the consequences and there was a time when this same game was being played over the radio people phoning in and asking for help with their problems over the radio was a smaller number of people making a lot more money and it seems so easy for people in the audience to judge you as a broadcaster to be a good person or to judge what you say as good advice without ever giving the slightest thought to the person you're advising or the real world outcomes of the advice you're giving hypothetically let's just say i talk to a father who speaks spanish as his first language father wife kids they all speak spanish as their primary language most the time but they know for their kids for their future as a family what really matters is having the children grow up with the ability to speak english at a very high level to use the english language in a sophisticated way and let's just say this guy whatever his situation may be it doesn't really matter whether he's someone who has immigrated to the united states or canada or if he's living in a spanish-speaking country but nevertheless for his children's particular education and career path this is this is his concern let's say this guy comes to me for advice or he just complains he just talks to me and complains and say to him look here's what you have to do every day in the morning before you go to work you are going to download on your phone the youtube video for the morning news in english now i don't know when you're going to listen to it maybe it's while you're riding the bus to work like i don't know this guy's situation hypothetically maybe it's during your lunch break at work you are going to listen to the news in english you're going to have a pen and paper and you are going to note down the words and concepts and phrases and idioms that you don't know that are tricky for you and you're going to look them up and you're gonna learn what they really mean and once in a while not every day once in a while there will be some chapter of history that comes up in the news that you didn't know about and you read the wikipedia article do a little bit of reading outside of the news every night at the dinner table you sit with your wife and kids and you watch the news together you don't watch the nightly news you watch the news that you downloaded this morning and that you have already watched yourself maybe once maybe two times where you've already looked up the vocabulary tell them you've seen it before keep it a secret they're they're going to be surprised they're going to be oh wow it seems like you already know all the difficult words that came up in the news doesn't matter let them voice their opinions chit chat with them about what they say what they think in english right and do it seven nights a week never skip a night and for your kids maybe they speak to all their friends in spanish like maybe the only language used around the dinner table otherwise is spanish but whatever that is let's say it's one hour a night maybe some nights it's 45 minutes maybe sometimes it's half an hour sometimes the news is more interesting there's less those discussions you have with your kids over years it's going to result in you raising your level of sophistication in english language it's going to result in your kids raising their level of sophistication english language it's going to result in your kids getting to know you in a way they otherwise wouldn't it's going to result in you getting to know your kids in a way you otherwise wouldn't you're going to hear their reactions to political things in the news and sometimes your kids are going to ask questions like what what a crazy law how can that be illegal when this other thing is illegal and maybe you've already looked it up on wikipedia and you say oh yeah you know it's a funny law that was passed 150 years ago and still nobody has changed it and maybe you say well you know that's an interesting point kid i'm going to look that up on wikipedia tomorrow and tell you about it when i get home from work now think about the value of that language learning exercise of that educational device night after night after night after years think about how much you have to pay someone else to do it for you or what it would be worth if you could pay someone else to do it for you okay what you are doing with your kids and what you are learning yourself i can't say it's invaluable but like this would be tens of thousands of dollars worth of education this is so much better than what you're going to get in language courses the way they're taught at a university where it does indeed cost you tens of thousands of dollars and without digressing into my experience with language education and universities let's just say i am sadly in a position to know let's just say i know a family of russian immigrants who have the opposite problem this is this is less hypothetical really neither of these examples is entirely hypothetical these all relate to real people i've known it the real world let's say i know a family who have migrated from russia to canada and the father of the family is completely fluent in russian he speaks at a really high level but the wife and kids that either speak no russian at all or they can kind of say hello they can kind of say a few things they maybe have some experience hearing the language maybe spoken by their grandmother or something but they can't really respond in complete sentences now what if i give the exact same advice you know inside out and backwards i say hey look every day before you go to work you download the morning news in russia because your kids have grown up completely fluent in english they're going to school in english all their friends speak english inside the house they speak to their mom in english they speak to you in english that's not the problem the problem is they have no engagement with the russian language right and you download this you listen to it before you go home to eat dinner whether that's during your lunch break or some other time you are listening to the news you're noting down maybe what you think are difficult idioms or concepts vocabulary terms of phrase and then you're going to watch the news with them i presume while you eat dinner so that you're going to talk it through with them you're going to let them voice their opinions debate with you debate amongst themselves and this way you're going to have a have a bilingual family isn't it easy for all of you right now to sit here in the audience and say wow that's really good advice it might be really easy for you to even get some kind of sense of my moral character that i'm a really good guy because oh i have really good motivations wow what a great guy what great advice like there are all kinds of kind of positive generous things you might be thinking about what's the problem you don't know who i'm giving advice to and you don't know the outcomes you don't know the consequences and none of us none of us have to deal with a consequence how rare is it for anyone whether they're doing health advice like workout exercise diet language learning advice political advice how rare is it to really deal with the outcomes of the advice that you give and a lot of us a lot of us had a father who tried to sit and watch the news with us in whatever language in our first language or some other language and the result was that we regarded our own father as insane we regarded our own father as an overbearing bullying ignorant madman that instead of creating closer bonds of you know love and respect within the family this was deeply alienating it resulted in the children hating the father and the father hating the children everyone becoming aware of the generation gap in political values now some of you have no idea what i'm talking about some of you are sitting there thinking oh well my dad was a great guy it would have been really wonderful some of you are thinking that your dad spoke russian or spoke spanish and you wish you'd learned more from him and this this sounds really great okay was your father homophobic some of us had parents who were really homophobic and then we grew up going to a different school in a different time with different political sensitivities did your father believe in the moon landing so people had parents who were born conspiracy they think the moon landing never happened what did your father say to you about hiv aids what if your father was a communist what if your father was a neo-nazi like a lot of people have parents with beliefs that you know when you're a child it's an exaggeration to say your parents beliefs contrast with your own because if you're at such an early stage of development normally what you're seeing is that your parents beliefs clash with what your school teacher tells you your parents beliefs clash with what you you hear from the television news if you're a child who reads a newspaper you know and uh you know it's not enough to follow up with someone by email which is what most of us do social media influencers no matter how large or small our fame is and guys there's a lot of money in uh in giving advice this one girl i've been shouting out on my patreon i'm sorry to say girl she's a middle-aged woman who will give you uh diet advice on being a vegan for 399 dollars a month well if you've got 10 clients that's real money there's another one who charges even more that i discovered recently um i discovered it for this reason i was like well if i have if i have people mind if you want this kind of thing can i can i recommend this person the one who charges more though she has formal university credentials and this stuff just interestingly but you know you can charge people 500 a month and you can charge people 500 a session to talk to them to motivate to motivate them to give them advice okay if you ask them to follow up with you afterward like you know you want an email back saying that they lost 20 pounds or you want an email back from the parents saying oh yeah now my kid can speak this language so much better you want some kind of testimonial do you think you'll ever learn what you would learn by actually sitting in the room and watching them eat dinner together and watching them sit in front of the news right what you'd pick up on in that room the reality is the advice i have just given would work wonderfully if your child was like me i was a highly intellectually demanding child i don't say highly intellectual i say intellectually demanding i asked a lot of questions and i had very combative very active debates with my parents from an incredibly early age i was what you'd call an actively engaged learner a lot of kids aren't a lot of kids sit looking down at their shoes being ashamed of themselves and not participating they're let's not get into the full range of negative behaviors that are possible where you can't get your kid to participate you can't get your kid to respond as a described hypothetically this being possibly a wonderful exercise for the right kid the method i've just described would work wonderfully if your father were the kind of guy i am and there are a whole lot of different characteristics that go into that including having the detachment to set your own political views aside right like that you're you're not just gonna sit and rant at the news reader that what they're saying is propaganda and it's crazy but that you know you're actually you know i may have strongly held views for example on the war in afghanistan and my girlfriend melissa gets to hear me ranting at the news i do i indulge in these kinds of theatrics and say what an imbecile the person is okay if i'm sitting with my daughter or if in future i have another child hypothetically you know i've got to put all that aside and sit there and say oh so that's interesting this is what they said about afghanistan why do you think they said that you know when you have to you know if your kid is eight years old at an eight-year-old level break it down and hear their answer and you're not you know you're not imposing your character over the news you're not imposing what you're hearing onto what they're hearing you get to go through the wonder and the curiosity and and confusion with them okay it's not gonna work for every parent it's not gonna work for every child i don't want to admit to myself how few children are capable of benefiting from this i want to believe that i live in a world where like 90 percent of kids this would be great for and it's probably not even five percent i don't want to admit to myself how many parents are either intellectually incapable of doing this or emotionally incapable of doing this i don't want to admit to myself i would love to believe in the illusory world or every father and every grandfather is capable with real warmth and generosity of spirit of preparing this kind of exercise frankly even in their first language and their mother tongue let alone their their second language and really putting in the work and really caring and really helping the next generation learn how to listen to and talk about politics develop advanced ability in the idioms this way what percentage of parents are capable of that really and if i don't think about a hypothetical parent think about actual people and actual parents i've known face to face how many of them could possibly do it and the the answer is like zero so is it is it good advice or is it bad advice if your understanding of good advice is pandering to the crowd if if i'm trying to convince you guys to donate money to my patreon account or pay for my monthly course i could give a monthly course on parenting guys what's that worth 399 a month scott sky's the limit i consider the whole philosophy of education at least one chapter of my book is about philosophy education i think i think more than one chapter uh deals oh yeah oh sure i can present myself as a guru and i can present this kind of advice that makes me sound morally good and maybe in a sense for you listening to it you feel morally good and you recognize it in this this detached way as good advice because you're not thinking about the people implementing it and what it would be like for you to sit there at that dinner table now i don't think i need to digress in how this works for everything from quitting smoking quitting alcohol quitting video games to you know weight loss gaining muscle you know diet and exercise this this kind of advice um if the advice you're giving is not working out for people can you expect them to send you an email that really breaks down that really shares that really explains where they're going wrong how and why it is that this this just isn't going to work out for them um could an email from a former client someone who who paid you could it tell you what you need to know in the same way that just sitting with them i mean frankly sitting with them at the dinner table sitting with them when they when they go to the gym where you can see the advices is not going to help them now physical exercises is one of the easiest things to give advice on but what i see again and again is a certain kind of highly athletic person giving advice that could only possibly be useful for people who have a whole lot in common with themselves you know oh we'll just wake up in the morning and jog before you go to work why why do you think that doesn't work why do you think people don't do it maybe you can't relate maybe like maybe you can't do what i just did and admit to yourself a really large percentage of people cannot use that advice will not use that advice maybe you can't admit to yourself like hey in this world like like i wish i lived in a world where 90 of people could just take this advice and do it right but the real percentage is much less and of course those aren't the people who are going to pay you for your advice shout out to everybody in the audience we got 20 people here if we had 20 thumbs up some more people might join us from my perspective this can be a real short live stream i don't always have to go for two hours and three hours these things also if melissa wants to jump in and and make a comment so what up james what up frida what up william what up uh yeah chris i've seen you here before so these are the people commenting of course lydia lydia lydia has been watching the channel what seven years some of that shout out to lydia you know um right so frida's raising nutrition point i want to talk about a sec melissa anything you want to say you've just been laughing and smiling a lot yeah i think it's been very interesting it's different than where i thought it was going to go so yeah i want to hear free to ask you nacho in the crowd another longtime viewer a long time supporter here oh um humility and risk taking humility and recklessness humility and being willing to deal with the consequences of taking a risk i was listening to one of these guys while i was working out at the gym who gives a lot of advice on the internet and i was listening to a youtube video that was really criticizing him very harshly so i might as well show them out it was a youtube video harshly criticizing gary vee so his full name is gary vaynerchuk i believe but his youtube channel he goes by his garyvee and he is a mass phenomenon in giving advice he's appeared on the joe rogan show he's appeared on broadcast television he's become a mainstream icon in what could be frankly called the advice industry you know i commented to my girlfriend melissa while we were both at the gym exercising i said you know it's really easy to ridicule this advice that he's giving but i have known specific people there are some people there are specific types of people for whom this is good and necessary advice but it's just ridiculous it's just surreal to give this advice to anyone and everyone and this guy's method whether he's doing like a phone-in talk show which he does he has people just call him up you know he listens to them talk for about a sentence and a half and then jumps to giving the advice right or someone's this live q a with an audience once in a while i think somebody has written him an email or something but for the most part it's on the basis of no knowledge of this person no knowledge of their character or their behaviors or their traits like no knowledge for example if if they're lazy or hard-working some people are lazy some people have obsessive-compulsive disorder you know what i mean okay i've got to do this give a brief digression now one of my ex-girlfriends who will remain unspecified her mother joined a crazy cult in india that's my opinion she didn't refer to it as a crazy cult herself she referred to it as a dharma group or some some craft like this and she actually went to india and lived in the lived in the ashram as they like to say and by the way it's one of these groups in india where for some reason everything is conducted in english it's it's getting money out of white people that's the reality you know so it's an all english language spiritual retreat and ashram and you know what their whole spiritual practice was their whole spiritual practice had to do with focusing on undertaking an action while not caring about the outcomes that you're you're supposed to just learn to appreciate the process without having attachment to the to the product or the outcome so and this involved giving them tasks that were impossible and pointless uh like wrapping and unwrapping mangoes like you have a whole cart with hundreds and hundreds of members or thousands wrapping and unwrapping them with with saran wrap this is a spiritual practice and you know so i'm having this described to me by my girlfriend's mother would this actually be helpful for some incredibly rare personality type someone with a particular type of obsessive compulsive disorder and is it possible that the original guru spiritual guru who founded this ashram that he had this obsessive-compulsive disorder where like you get over it by wrapping and unwrapping mangoes doing a whole bunch of other pointless and impossible uh activities then learning to set aside your attachment to uh to the outcomes of your action but for how many people like is it 99 of people or 99.9 percent of people would this be a completely fruitless comple fruitless no pun intended a completely pointless activity right and then of course you think about the method of recruitment and how these cult groups operate um and what i'm saying in this video is i don't think in the 21st century this is the exception to the rule i think this is the rule like people commit to giving a certain kind of advice first and foremost that's their sense of mission that's their destiny like for the person doing the broadcasting and soon enough they have a whole you know codery of kind of employees and colleagues putting together these touring shows or they give advice and so on everyone gets committed to the message everyone gets committed to the gospel if you like to the advice that is being given with no thought whatsoever applied to the particular people receiving the vice the advice let alone evaluating the outcomes anyways just a couple hours ago i'm at the gym with melissa i say you know okay so listening to this criticism of gary vee garyvee is a business impresario and a self-declared millionaire i have no reason to think he's not a multi-millionaire by the way but anyway a very wealthy person who claims to give you the keys to success and so on you know and one of the things he tells people again and again and again advice he gives to people again and again again is you should never take a holiday you should never take a vacation you shouldn't take any time for yourself you should wake up every day and and hustle like dawn told us until you're completely exhausted you should work incredibly hard and he's given this advice to anybody and everybody so sometimes it's just like it's the same format i have here he just sits down in front of a camera and speaks to you an unknown person in the audience it's just telling you to work as hard as you possibly can from the moment you wake up to when you go with sleep and never stop and never take a vacation and just give it 110 all the time he doesn't even know what you're working on he doesn't know you know what are you doing like you know no nuance nothing no way relative uh to the particular person and sometimes he's giving this advice relative to a particular person who's phoned him like he does a phone show or someone who stood up in the audience and asked the question and i'm not saying that's the hate on the guy but most of the time the person doesn't get to finish their question like people stand at the eye and say hey you know i've been trying for a few years to be successful in real estate and you know i haven't really and he says let me tell you my you know he jumps right in like you know he's not really interested in hearing your story or what's holding you back or something he's just looking for the pretense for him to say something he said with minor variations a hundred times before to give you the same advice he'd give he'd give anyone else okay well you know i can't sit here and say to you that this kind of work works so hard that you pass out you know advice i can't say that's bad advice for everyone right i'll give you you know i can't say that i feel that growing up with my generation i grew up with the kurt cobain generation i grew up with the nirvana generation i grew up with a whole generation of people who really glamorized giving up and not trying hard i have known people who could really use the advice of someone sitting there and talking to them and saying look what if you gave it a hundred percent what if you worked so hard at this that you broke down weeping you know what i mean and i'm not saying this to insult you guys i don't know who's in the audience now again if you guys can hit the thumbs up some more people will join the conversation while it's happening just makes it more entertaining more people will discover the video later too but you know you might not know what it's like to really push yourself to that ragged edge where you're learning as much as you can possibly do you're working as much as you possibly can and where you're at the end of it you're trembling or you're even like weeping like you're not even sad you're weeping out of you know nervous exhaustion you're you're weeping just because you're so depleted and broken down having given it you know 110 percent uh you're cracking up you know in in plain english now i i have various memories of of doing that i remember one brief period where i had an airplane ticket to cambodia i was going to cambodia alone and i knew i was going to have to get off that plane with all my money and cash on me i was going to walk the streets and rent an apartment i was gonna go through a whole bunch of things i was gonna have to speak to landlords in cambodia so i'm working so hard to raise my level of spoken cambodian and i'm honestly it's not even setting an alarm i'm just waking up whether it's at 4am or 5am or 6am i'm waking up whenever i wake up a nervous wreck and i'm pouring it on as hard as i freaking can sitting there completely alone nobody talking to me nobody helping me alone working on the language and really giving up i can remember you know cracking up like emotionally getting cracked up with this because i was trying in some number of days to raise my level of ability in in the cambodian language which is not an easy language um and i have very bad materials to work with and so on too not worth not worth filling on those details you know there are different specific you know obviously short periods of time i can remember of really pushing the limit in terms of how many hours i can work for for intellectual work and nobody nobody can do that for 10 years or something you can do you can do it and some of you might not know what that's like i had a girlfriend many many years ago she was blonde you might have heard of her she's called my blonde ex-girlfriend she's mentioned in a few different youtube videos and you know um basically during the whole relationship or the main part of the relationship we were really living together like as if we were married you know we were sharing an apartment living together closely you know she wanted to become a painter a modern painter not a house painter you know she wanted to do modern art um as a creative artist and i can remember saying to her really as nicely as possible i wasn't being a kind of dramatic showman like gary vee i wasn't even being as dramatic as i'm being now on camera i remember saying to her look you know i come home every day i had a full-time job i come home every day i rented this apartment for you i got this studio i bought all these materials for you i did i literally bought like the easel and the canvas and the paint and stuff because you say this is what you want to do and i see that you're not working i see that you're not making progress or when you are it's like one hour here or there that you're putting in if you want to be a successful painter you are competing with people who have wanted this and have worked so hard at it since they were 11 years old all right so here you are i forget let's say she was 24 at the time something like that 24 25. you know you're coming in relatively late at the game and you have to work twice as hard as everyone else just to catch up with them over like the next 10 years if you think about how many hours you spend drawing how many hours do you spend painting practicing the art practicing the craft if you like if you only work twice as hard as they do you know they start at age 11 you're starting at h it's 24 right how hard are you gonna have to work in 10 years to catch up to be competitive now i gave i gave different examples then that i would give today so let's just be trying to you know i'm a much older man now i use different kinds of examples but i think you know one of the examples i gave was talking about being a pilot being like an airline pilot an army pilot or any other kind of pilot because i know that that's one job where they actually record how many hours you've flown even at the earliest stages of being you know practicing to become policy look today at the time i was the same age i was i was slightly younger than her so i was 24 and she was 25 or i was 23 and she was 24 or some of that we had this conversation you know i said look if i decide today to become a pilot i've got to compete with guys who joined the air force cadets when they were 14 years old 15 years old started flying at 16 years old right i can't just do the bare minimum maybe they can like maybe they're my age they don't really have to put in the time anymore they don't have to work that much anymore they're at a point where they can kind of coast along with the level of effort they're making not me i've got to work twice as hard i've got to work 10 times as hard i've got it i remember i used this term all the time with her i said you've got to do kind of proof of genius level effort you've got to put in a level of effort where you're like proving your genius you're you're knocking yourself out and i know i use this example in discussion time because i was really doing it i had a full-time job but like before i went to work after i came home from work i was working on this ancient dead language called pali it's like look you know i imagined there were all kinds of talented people in this field had been working really hard for many years and at a high level of ability in the language i later learned that was not true there's almost nobody with reading comprehension of pali all the people who claim to have ability and pali as a language they're basically frauds i don't know if i can think of a single exception i'd have to think for a while if there were any scholars who were not frauds about their level of comprehension of that language um but most of the people including people with phds including buddhist monks so on and so forth it's like look i'm coming into this field of study late after getting a university degree in political science i didn't come out i wasn't already committed to buddhist studies when i was 16. well there are other people who've been doing this since they were 16. i can't just do one hour here and there i can't just scrape by i have to work twice as hard as everyone else or i have to work 10 times as hard i have to put in a level of effort and and risk you know where there's really some some proof of genius involved okay here's the thing all right giving advice it involves humility it involves the advisor involves the broadcaster involves the person in my position really having the humility to listen to the other person letting them tell you who they are letting them tell you what their problem is letting them tell you what they deserve and also you have to have the humility to let them show you right they have to demonstrate you have to be able to just sit there quietly and watch right there's there's real humility involved you also have to have the arrogance to take risks right you have to be willing to take a risk to say to someone you know even just what i said look i come home from work i was literally working at the office come home from the office and i look in at your studio you know which has this separate room for painting and i can see ain't nothing moved you know what i mean like there's no new painting there's no new drawing you're not making progress you're not working you're not putting the time you know and when you really know somebody and you're dealing with them face to face what do you risk yeah will you risk them breaking down crying in front of you and you risk you have to hold them and hug them while they weep all over you and blow their nose on your sleeve or whatever else right like on a on a very basic level you're risking dealing with the emotional consequences of them recognizing that even if in some sense you are giving good advice you're giving advice that maybe a better person would follow or a better person wouldn't even need maybe a better person would already know this maybe a better person would just sit back right on you know that's that's what i've been saying all these years too you know what i'm on the same wavelength i'm on the same level as you someone else will come back this way and know this is the person who needs the advice but it is as the proverb goes it's the good advice that they just can't take you know did you want do you want to jump in stand up or just speak so i've been thinking about something as you've been talking about this there is a scene from the movie donnie darko yes that i think is relevant to this discussion in donnie darko there is a self-help guru who becomes very popular in their town and he gives a presentation to an audience of teenagers his main advice is that everything wrong with you all your problems are based in fear so his main goal is to solve your problems through solving what you're afraid of and getting to the root problems of your fear the scene is great because he invites these kids down and they talk about their problems and they're on stage and and talking about these difficulties in their life there's one kid who's chubby and he said he gets bullied by people and the self-help guru says you know you you know kind of like gary vee here like at the first moment he says no i know what your problem is you know you're afraid the reason why this scene is uh important is because uh donnie darko the character played by jake gyllenhaal he he gets up on the microphone and he just boldly says you know what this self-help guru i think he's the spawn of satan i think he's lying to you kid your problem is that you're chubby if you want to stand up to your bullies you have to lose weight you have to get fit you have to like you know he's really honest and like you say he's taking risks all right um and the kid might break down crying right right like that's that's really tough um but that's what it takes if you're trying to give advice to people and sometimes it is so obvious i mean just when you look at i i really appreciate what you said about observing people if you observe them in their environment right talking to family or something you get to see these things that they might not have the attachment or ability to cope with if somebody just points it out yeah and and including you know the ways in which they're stupid people are stupid and lazy now you know i've said this about my father before so if you've been watching my channel for a million years you already know this but for me it's a memory that really stands out that he took like 10 years to read one book it was james joyce's ulysses right now you know um my father had some intellectual advantages in life he was very good at memorizing factoids um something some little short piece of information so like the exact size of a parking space for a normal car versus a wheelchair disabled car like crap like that he really memorized like i don't even know it was an effort or not like i don't know if he just did that without trying very likely he did he did try but he'd always been gifted at memorizing factoids this way and just to give an example uh you know just assuming he wasn't lying to me he lied a lot but i'm gonna presume this particular story was the truth um he took a course on geology in universities this is a ba level uh course on geology and he only took it because he wanted to raise his grade point average raise his total like to get an a plus and a course and he had absolutely no interest in geology he didn't want like you know it was just to get high scores in the exams and he felt this was a course where he could do that he just had to memorize the names of different kinds of rocks and chemicals and there's a certain number of kind of factoids and he got the highest score on the exam that anyone had ever gotten since they opened the university and they've been using the same exam for 40 years or some some long period of time using the same standardized exam for geology and he said the professor approached him and asked if he would be willing to to switch his major and the professor said that he would personally support my father if you wanted to start a career as a geologist because he was so impressed by the exam and my father said then this part was not a lie my father said that he did not have any understanding of what he had memorized and i that was really true of him he was that kind of like he could memorize and recite things that he really didn't understand what he was saying so just mentioned this was kind of guy my father was but like dude like 10 years that's how long it took you to read this one book like like he did so little reading like so my point is in a lot of ways he was a very lazy very stupid guy um and again i've said this you know one of the things i said directly to my father was i know you the way nobody else knows you because my father was a character like gary v he was a character like gary vaynerchuk who stood on a stage and gave people advice he really was his career i said these other people they see you this way these other people they see you this way but i know you as the guy who would fall asleep on the couch watching baseball that's who he really was he was a guy who would lie on the couch and watch baseball and when he was overseas like when he was in europe the thing he was most excited to do and it was quite expensive he would buy a copy of an american newspaper like the new york times the new york times is expensive in america but it's actually much more expensive if you're in london or paris this is still true but it was true back then too like to buy a copy of the new york times in some other city in europe and he would buy it just to turn to the last page and there'd be a little section like this which would be the baseball scores and he'd sit there and stare at that excitedly and very often the rest of the newspaper didn't get read or was barely as you buy it just to sit there and he'd sit there and look at it and talk he was totally engrossed and this is him over 50 years old this is a fully grown maybe some of these memories are from his first words that's that's who my father was so like you know again when you say someone stupid was this one adjective to describe a complex person and a complex set of problems i mean i think you guys just from this description you guys have never met my father you know you already have a real insight into what this guy's problems are and why he isn't learning and why he doesn't develop and what is what is advantages and disadvantages okay now what advice you know are you are you going to give him now look you know for me this relates to the recurring theme of my not endorsing particular books on youtube i do book reviews i do read books you'll never see me out here just saying oh this is a good book that everyone should read you know i had a whole bunch of email from this uh this on youtube called um vegan foot soldier you know so some of this is on my blog if you guys don't know um it's not fascinating but he's a he's a rival youtuber i suppose of he's vegan but he doesn't he doesn't feel that he and i have too much in common and you know there are many things about what he wrote to me that are striking and absurd and risible and make me laugh but the final message i sent to the guy was very sincere i said look have you read karl popper's book the poverty of historicism now i'll type out the title because i know it's a really weird title poverty of historicism there is only one book with this crazy title and i'm certain i have a i have a video talking about it on my youtube channel i'll post that for you guys too you know and what i said to him was you know look um i didn't say what i really meant because i didn't want to be too insulting what i really meant to say was you fundamentally don't understand what philosophy is you keep kind of preaching philosophy he kept insulting me claiming that i don't know anything about philosophy he said that i'm at a high school level in philosophy that i'm not even at a first year university student's level he was using his supposedly advanced knowledge of philosophy to snub me and insult me and miraculously i seem to be immune to this kind of humiliation especially when it's coming from someone like him this did not upset me uh in any way but you know what i said to him because i was trying not to be overly insulting i said look you know philosophy is a problem problem-solving method it's about solving problems and i didn't say this but my point was like it's not about bullying and intimidating people with ostentatious use of formal logic like oh well you failed to substantiate proposition three it's not the way it's not the way people who really know philosophy talk you know it's not this is not really what philosophy is you know and i said to him look you know have you thought about reading this particular book karl popper's the poverty of historicism i said to him it could really change your life um how many years have i known that guy before i recommended this book you know more than five years he and i have known each other you know obviously there are some ways in which he's a stranger to me i don't know him at all but there are other ways in which having known him for five years having had so many years of harassment from him so many insults and so on both publicly and and privately from him against me and seeing now the way he's building up his own ego and what he thinks about philosophy and what he says about philosophy it's like well look i know a particular book that's going to challenge what you think philosophy is and what its meaning is in your life this could really change your life this is a book i recommend for for this person you know um you know i'm not out here saying we have 29 people in the united stand all 29 of you should read karl popper's philosophy of historicism i'm i'm not i'm not melissa here there are many books i've recommended she read in particular this is a book that meant a lot to me in my life and i can sit here in an analytical way and talk about why it was meaningful to me why it challenged or counteracted some false assumptions i had in life right i i can tell you why it was meaningful important to me i can tell you why i think it would be meaningful important to this other guy this other youtuber vegan foot soldier right but by the same token if melissa actually said to me after this live stream oh hey well do you think i should read this book i would say to her no look honestly i think would be a waste of your time i don't think it's interesting for you i don't think it's meaningful for you another another really brief example of that but we had this conversation in a bookstore uh lately there was a nice big copy of herodotus on the bookstore shelf in the last four and a half years or so melissa has told me pardon me melissa has heard me tell several anecdotes about herodotus things come up like oh yeah herodotus it says x y and z uh it's a book i have read i have a pretty good recollection of and there was a nice just the actual book was a good-looking book it was a good price it was cheap it was good deal and melissa was taking this out of the shelf and saying oh maybe now is the time for her to read herodotus huge book by the way and you know i said to her completely honestly look even though i can tell you why this was meaningful to me why this was important for me i can also tell you why i don't think it's important for you why i don't think it's it's useful for you now guys um i could i could turn to the audience and ask you if you guys have any stories of this in the old days when we broadcast on younow you guys were able to actually jump in and talk to me by voice chat those are the days we can't do that here with youtube you'll be able to actually split the screen and have two windows with two cameras it was great it was a great feature of you know unfortunately younow is a dead website it's a dead platform um there's a much darker side of this isn't there the the darker side is people tell you you can never make it as a musician just quit just give up now people tell you oh no you'll never be able to get a phd in chemistry just become a dental hygienist that's an easy living for somebody like people including authority figures whether it be your school teacher your guidance counselor your priest your parents your grandparents you know um people within the university system like a professor people are going to make a snap judgment of you very often like gary vee based on just a few sentences you said and they will give you advice that changes your life forever now taking it outside of an institutional setting you know i can remember when i was living in places like thailand laos and cambodia really relying uh for colleagues on advice i could name all these people there's no reason not to there was a very shifty character and i would guess he weighed about 400 pounds he was a very very fat white guy and [Music] he was a homosexual with effeminate behaviors and he had a much younger boyfriend slash husband who was not fat and was not out of shape they were very seeing them together they were a very strange pair and um his whole manner and way of speaking to you did not inspire trust he seemed like a very shifty very strange character and i spoke to a woman who was a white canadian the same age as myself who was his employee and i was asking as politely as possible look you know do you think i can trust this guy do you really think i should get involved with this with this company and so on and i remember at that time she gave this completely glowing completely positive account of her experience as an employee and what a good guy he was and everything else and i made a series of decisions that really changed my life for the next several years on the basis of that conversation like okay this is what you said to me you know okay well you know and that's someone who's worked with him for let's say she wore them for five years i'm remembering it's ten years she'd been there she'd been there for quite a while maybe it was ten years and i'm wrong i don't know anyway she'd been working with this guy for for quite a long time and so on now my actual you guys will have guessed my actual experience with this guy was incredibly negative um i had a really negative impact on my life made my life while i was in this communist country laos much harder in many ways and it would be an exaggeration to say he was ripping me off but it seemed to me he was really misleading and manipulating a great many people not just myself and having a negative impact on their lives and i ran into this same young woman again but you know again she was the same age i was white canadian i said well look you know this this is what's been happening lately with this guy the the head of the company the ceo of the company and she immediately just said to me yeah well you know i hear about that all the time he's done that to so many people it seems like a pattern his behavior he just does it again and again you know you could have told me that first before i rented an apartment and unpacked my bags and said like i before i was you know making a whole lot of assumptions including financial assumptions because it's like you know and that young woman she doesn't make any money out of lying to me or something she doesn't have any agenda and indeed the fact that she was so forthcoming when i said that to her the second time we we talked shows that she was in some ways a very honest person so my point is here you know advice um she doesn't assume any responsibility she doesn't assume any risk right now a few of you uh know this about me oh that's funny nacho says i remember gary vee yelling at someone not to become a dentist [Laughter] so something paralyzing uh for more than a year now i've been talking to people about going into film perhaps i should say going further into film given that youtube itself is a kind of filmmaking um but getting seriously interested in raising the level of my own effort and yeah raising the level amount of risk too and so many different people told me don't go to film school don't go back to college don't try to get a filter don't try to get any film training at all just start making films now the people who said this uh one i can name him one is ali tabrizi you guys remember him i like to breezy former vegan youtuber is one of the guys i talked to about this so ali tabrizi used to be on youtube and then under certain extraordinary circumstances he made the leap to uh documentary filmmaking for netflix and he has made one documentary film that took him about five years i'm not hating on him but that's the truth i think that was at least five years of that uh what was it called was called fish i was gonna say fish apocalypse that's a better name fishpocalypse if anyone uses that title you owe me 10 fishpocalypse no anyway i have made my own uh review of that film on my own youtube channel and mysteriously after i made this review of his film he never spoke to me again life is long maybe i'll hear from him five years now or 10 years you know he was so strident he was so insistent to me no no no get out just learn it yourself start doing just teach yourself don't go back to college and i'm going to come back to ali tabrizi it's the main anthony i want to tell her but you know one of the other people who told me this she is herself a professor in a university department that does exactly this they do cinema filmmaking uh photography you know several subjects of it but she's seeing the reality of every day and she said to me no joke she said you are better off just watching youtube videos like this one and she gave me a link to a channel it was a youtube channel talking you through cinematography filmmaking how to use the equipment like you know you can imagine there are these kinds of channels self-help educate yourself that's someone she her whole career she's earned her living at least for 20 years being a professor in one of those departments and even she is saying film school is a ripoff film school is a joke okay two things these people don't know me right this isn't advice for me it's for some other person they're thinking about it might be advice for someone who is like themselves right that might and it might not they might have some stereotype notion of who they're giving advice to who a typical student is who a typical person is receiving right this is this problem and the other problem is they accept no risk whatsoever so i don't have to go on about this it's just one example of my life and there are many i'll give maybe maybe one more on another topic you know um but you know one of the things i said to ali sorry he was saying with complete certainty and he was speaking as a successful filmmaker now he's got one film but it's a successful film i gave it a negative review in case you haven't guessed but it's on netflix it's had some number of views um i said to him yeah the stuff you're saying about you can just teach yourself you can learn without any teachers you can learn without going back to college ally do you know how to get up on a rooftop with two actors and one camera and film a fist fight a very simple fundamental scene do you know where to put the camera show up with the actors you know where to block it out do you know how to film one person punching another and in cinema it means they're pretending to punch the other you know the camera's at the right angle so you have the illusion that the fist is connecting again if you guys don't know i used to be in the theater so i do know a little bit about this i've done some of that stuff back when i was in the theater like 100 years ago when i was a young man i'm aware like put it this way i'm aware that there are tricks of the trade i am by no means a master but like i'm aware there are things you need to technically know about how to safely block out a fist fight so fist fight on a rooftop you know can you do it and if you can't how are you gonna learn it and how so i'm in my 40s how do you think i'm going to learn it do you think someone's going to take me aside and out of the goodness of their heart like you know train me in all that they know expecting nothing in return like again somebody maybe these people are also they're used to giving advice to someone who's 18 years old or something and they go you're young and good looking just go to hollywood and someone's going to take you aside and teach you what you know maybe someone who wants to sleep with you or something i don't know what the motivations are maybe because you're young and good looking there's some assumption that someone is going to share this kind of acknowledge you well guess what i'm a very self-confident slightly scary looking dude in my mid-40s nobody's going to help me nobody's going to work with me for free nobody's going to mentor me right how am i going to learn how to film a fist fight in rooftop and we can say this straight to ally to breezy the maker of that film cause i'm sorry the film was like on on a technical filmmaking level you can tell this guy doesn't know what to do with the camera you know there's no you know cinema in terms of cinematography the film is garbage it's not a well-filmed well edited well put together even the storyline or whatever you want to say the the narrative coherence is very poor in a lot of obvious ways it's it's a bad film i'm vegan on some level of course i sympathize with the messages trying to get a voice but i can't say it's a well-made film it's a poorly made film it looks like a film made by an amateur looks like exactly what it is a guy who went from youtube to professional filmmaking with no training and nobody to help him and none of those skills neither in terms of the storytelling the scripting the cinematography whatever it looks like a film made by a guy who could not put together a fist fight on a rooftop to save his life right um so you see you don't know me and you aren't really taking on any kind of risk right what if this is the wrong advice what if is this is the worst advice what if you are crippling me for the rest of my career because i didn't take two years to go to a community college and do a simple course in cinematography where they teach you the hands-on nuts and bolts of how to put the camera together and how to position it how to film that kind of scene how to set up the lighting how to set up the camera what angle the guy's face needs to be at relative to the camera when the fist goes by how to position the microphones when you're filming a dialogue like there are technical aspects to cinematography that come up again and again and again and you are telling me to just move on with my career without getting any of those those fundamentals like it's not hard for me to imagine that having incredibly negative long-term consequences where for the rest of my life i'm depending on other people to bail me out to help me with my own lack of confidence again and again and again and these i've talked this through with these people everybody i've talked like it's not just a one-way thing they don't just send me advice and that's it even though i'm engaging in some kind of socratic dialogue with them it seems very difficult to get other people to take seriously the stakes the risks that are involved in in giving this kind of advice you know i just say um i can talk about languages and talk about humanitarian work you know this way i give so many examples of people telling me like oh no you'll never be able to live in cambodia you'll never be able to study this language you'll never be able to go there and do that and where in some cases literally what i said to them was have you met me like do you know who you're talking to like my problem is not a lack of will and self-discipline like if anything my problem is that i'm so willing to give it 110 you know getting nothing out of it and ends in disaster you know like but no or i'm so committed i'm so willing to move to cambodia i'm still willing to move to cambodia and learn the cambodian language i'm willing to move to myanmar and learn some ethnic minority language you know the united me and my boy i'm willing to commit to all kinds of research broad projects and language study and humanitarian work and go out in the jungle i'm willing to do all these things i'm willing to give it 110 but then when other people disappoint me people or institutions let me down on the other side like my personal virtue alone can't carry this through to you know a successful conclusion that's the recurring light motif of my life that's the recurring tragedy of my life you know when i went to saskatchewan to study korean ojibwe and one of the reasons i keep saying korean ojibway is because if i just say cree you don't even know it's a language nahi away what these are indigenous languages there but yeah the courses i took they did deal with both korean and chile i have no problem hitting the books i have no problem memorizing like just the nouns and verbs that comprise language i have no problem with the grammar like i have no problem with this level of self-discipline i did that before i taught myself pali i can work in a jungle with a flashlight sleeping under a mosquito every night sleeping under a mosquito net every night and study a language i don't need a teacher and i don't need anyone to coddle me i don't want to help me right but okay so you have that level of of will and determination and self-discipline and talent and ability or whatever right okay but what happens when everyone else lets you down what happens when the problem is you can depend on yourself but you can't depend on anyone else nobody ever talked any of that through with me right they gave advice to me that might have been good advice for some other person in some other scenario people gave me advice that might be good for a really kind of lazy schlumpy stupid uh privileged student at oxford or cambridge someone born into tremendous wealth who's able to go to cambridge or oxford and study some obscure language and get a phd in some area of study they really have no talent or focus or dedication or work ethic themselves but they have all these wonderful people around to help you know paid for of course paid for it at a high price and why do people give that advice probably because that's who they're used to talking to that's who they presume they're giving advice to or maybe hey let's keep it all real that's who they used to be themselves that's who they were growing up that's how they came up and where most of their advice is going to revolve around you know your lack of work ethic your lack of will and determination and it's going to presume massive levels of kind of subsidy assistance and help coming from others you're surrounded by highly competent people assuring you through a phd program or ushering you through a language program or you know really even if you're talking about research in the field or humanitarian work that you have like a whole team of people like in some organization like uh med san san francie uh you know doctors at borders like that you're part of some united nations style organization overseas that does everything for you including your laundry and now all you have to do is show the hard work talent and determination to get results because everyone else has done all the all the thinking and worrying for you well that wasn't my situation right and again you know so you're giving advice or you don't know pardon me you don't know my situation you don't know me and you don't uh assume any sense of responsibility uh for the consequences what if your advice goes horribly wrong and you know the final outcome is that people's lives are ruined and you know not just for a short time i knew a girl of here i am saying girl again well was she 20 years old i don't know i knew when she was 19 20 or 21 years old at university in canada she was born and raised in a muslim family and she wanted to go to the university of toronto to study buddhism and put his philosophy that was her big interest in life and everyone at the university said good for you by the way yes she was extremely good-looking yes i had the option to sleep with her and ended up not doing it there's a reason why we had this at the series of bizarre conversations with her immaterial this story but yeah probably the fact that she was extremely good looking was part of her experience of this she gets to the university and everyone's happy to take her money and everyone's happy to tell her whatever she wants oh buddhism oh good we'll sign you up for the buddhism program just make sure you pay your money and select your courses and sit down in class and do the right thing and the whole time that she was at the university of toronto she was there for four years there was only one class on buddhism she was able to take she lost the one opportunity of her life they committed to her there was a program she was supposed to be signed up for in in buddhist studies or buddhism she instead got a general ba in religion and you know i knew exactly the situation the department that time who the professors were and what was what was going on she had to do a whole pile of courses on christianity judaism and islam as one of the professors said to me and uh i was interviewing this professor for an article he wanted to be quoted he said what the university of toronto has is a department of christianity masquerading as a department of world religions that they were pretending to teach courses in these in these other subjects when they really just didn't have the didn't have the staff didn't have the will didn't have the interest or what have you you know well look you know is that a small thing you know there is no responsibility for the outcomes the people who gave her this bad advice the people who said just sign up and pay this money which was i'm sure for her a lot of money i'm sure for her family a lot of money just devote four years of your life to this you can trust us and she did not get an education in buddhism she did not get an education in buddhist philosophy and she would have learned more not taking the courses at all and her personal situation exactly why i had a little bit of a friendship with her and again it was kind of like a doomed romance with her it was this question whether or not we're going to get get into bed with each other um you know the reality of her situation is she was rebelling against her muslim family she had been raised in the islamic faith and she wanted out she wanted something new something different and it's not that rare a lot of muslims are drawn to buddhism because they want something that still will give them some sense of moral purpose and self-discipline and sobriety there's certain kind of characteristics they want from a religion but they want something that will set them free from the oppressive irrationality of you know the the muslim faith well you know what's she going to do with the rest of her career what she could do with the rest of her her life personally like philosophically this was the philosophical education she wanted and she she didn't get right and you know she's supposed to go on and get some kind of job after getting this completely useless ba in religion is she going to become a chaplain for the canadian anglican church she couldn't become a christian missionary christian missionary or christian christian uh you know minister you know so you know i've been through similar situations in my own life you know again and again and again um at the deepest level i think the problem that we have is that we do not think of advice as a product stick with me here for one minute if i sell you a product right i am responsible forever for that product if someone sells me this and i turn it on and it lights on fire they're liable for the product right the damage done by the fact that the battery ignited on uh on fire and and so on and so forth i have even seen this with some miracle weight loss remedies when it is a product when it's something you can touch or it's something you can eat or something you can drink we have this idea of personal responsibility that if you made the product if you made if you endorsed the product if you made these claims about the product that you are responsible forever you know economically morally and otherwise as a matter of your personal integrity if you are going to endorse this product if you were going to sell this product you are responsible for the consequences forever and ever and for some reason in our culture and in our legal system and in our political system we do not think that way about advice what would it mean to live in a society where people are really responsible for the outcomes of their advice"},{"id":"c3jgr5mKSBQ","text":""},{"id":"dcp37QaUFj8","text":"because what you're saying here is that if if we can prevent one mouse from dying you would kill all of the animals in existence yes because i'm in i'm in favor of reducing rights violations it's kind of like the non-aggression principle so like um the problem i have is that predators are the ones violating others rights so yeah like obviously i'm more in favor of protecting the innocent versus like like it's really strange too because weren't you attacking my position based on utilitarianism now it sounds like you have a utilitarian physician issue each other's heaven no that's not utilitarian logic that fits no that fit no you're being more utilitarian here i'm being more deontological you're the one being utilitarian yeah you are you said you wouldn't be in favor of killing nazis because it would result in more harm that's utilitarian no it's not youtube the nazis will kill all of these people and if i kill all the nazis then that's gonna um cause more harm so the utilitarian doesn't kill the nazis um you literally just said you wouldn't kill the nazis so you're proving my point you're being utilitarian in in the chat i've just posted something in the chat here um i actually prepared this in advance because i i anticipated stuff like this right well if that is genuinely your position it's a bizarre position because then you're just going to have to kill everyone and everything right because um you you hurt did you not listen to my proposition i said in circumstances where it reduces rights violations dude i said in circumstances where it reduces rights violations i'm in favor of killing predatory species right so you're saying that it reduces rights violations as part of your proposition but now when i'm asking you about one single rise so so obviously we've got you'd have to violate millions of of you would have to cause millions of rights violations to save one mouse okay let me ask you this like were you not in favor of like killing nazis like would you have been against world war ii uh like considering the german population was larger than the jewish population i i think we're getting slightly derailed no i'm not like i i don't see what the like dude i don't see what the issue is here considering the german population is bigger than the jewish population like would you be against um like would you be against like killing nazis yeah i think we should incapacitate nazis uh uh well you can't i wouldn't well you can't we're talking about a situation where you can only use lethal force so what do you mean like like assuming the nazi population was greater than the jewish population would you not be in favor of killing nazis to save jews even though that means you're going to end up killing more people than the nazis otherwise would kill yeah we're just talking about war um i don't this is like it it doesn't matter if we're talking about war like it's the same principle hey could you could you like just answer okay dude could you just answer the hypothetical because you still haven't done it supposing okay well no okay no no no you're weaseling out of it i want an affirmative answer if there were i want an affirmative answer you can't just weasel out of it and say i don't kill people i want an affirmative answer yes or no so if there were 10 million nazis and 5 million jews the only way to prevent those all of those 5 million jews from dying is to kill the 10 million nazis would you let the 10 million nazis kill all the jews uh yes or no yes or no you would let the 10 million nazis kill the 5 million jews oh god and i and i'm the one who's the the crazy person here okay because uh predatory animals are the aggressors here they're the one violet they're the ones violating the rights of prey species i'm in favor of protecting the rights of the prey species just like i'd be in favor of protecting the rights of the jews so the the delusion that these people are indulging in is that they can and should uh police the wilderness uh forcing you know these human created values onto uh sharks dolphins so on and so forth even if it means obliterating you know the entire food chain destroying ecology as we know it in the name of this ideal this ideal that seems to matter more than the teacher itself or or what have you now i've been kind of hinting at this repeatedly uh in this video what is the point of policing to use nacho's favorite word what is the justification for policing i don't i don't normally talk in terms of justifying things i think it's very misleading in english what we what we do and don't mean by justify or saying something is justified um to give an example you know if you have an atheist majority in a country modern atheist democratic majority and they are getting into policing the morality of the muslim minority in the country so this is happening right now in many countries in europe different places around the world happening in some parts of china um although without the democracy unfortunately with with only the chinese idea of democracy okay what is the justification anyone can argue back and both left-wing and right-wing people argue against this there are right-wing libertarians and there are left-wing bleeding hearts and so on who say well these people have their own culture why don't you just let it let them do it their own way you know they have their own marriage customs they have their own ceremonies their own music they have their own costume their own style of dress why you know if they want to cut off part of their dick in this ceremony called circumcision why don't you just let them do things their way why don't you just pretend that our laws can't and shouldn't apply to them let them carry on you know in their own way now this question is normally asked insincerely and it's normally answered insincerely but i want to answer it really sincerely i want to talk about what is the point of policing okay the justification for sober people policing drug addicts is entirely based on a claim about their human potential okay the reason why i don't want you to become a heroin addict is because i have a definite notion of who it is you could be and should be right now most of you if today with facebook you could really look this up think back to the classroom full of people you graduated high school with right how many of them are dead today i'm assuming i've have a middle aged audience some of you are watching this you're 18 you're like hey wait time i just graduated two weeks ago it's true i do i chose some teenage viewers okay all right if you're over 30 years old how many of the people you graduated from high school with are dead today how many of them are dead due to drug use or drug overdose and how many of them are alive but have completely ruined their lives with drug use they've completely rotted their brains or whatever they've frittered away fritter is not quite the right verb here they have squandered their human potential with drugs and alcohol okay the justification for the reason for the point of me policing you whether i'm the king or the dictator or whether we have a democracy where it's the majority of people voting in a referendum the fundamental reason for policing is that you have the potential to be something better to do something and you are going to lose that potential it's going to be snuffed out if i allow you to become a heroin addict when you're 16 years old you're never going to get there there is a kind of potential that a woman has that is snuffed out by allowing her to have her clitoris removed in what is called female circumcision there is a kind of human potential that is snuffed out when women are deprived of the opportunity to attend high school and university because they're part of a religion that wants them to just get married at the minute they're physically old enough to do so and that that puts them into a veil and gives them this operation and deprives them of ever having an education or a career right and guess what guys none of this relies on anything as certain as science or the laws of nature or evolution it's all political i think the problem with veganism precisely is that they don't regard what is political as political so let's give you an example one of the most common arguments made for veganism is that it's natural no it's not it's ridiculous they will make the argument that we are evolved to be vegan or specifically that were evolved to be frugivores fruitarian and then that it's a kind of crime against nature for you to eat meat it's completely ridiculous now i understand why it's gratifying no no this is an ethical decision this is a social and political movement and it has as much or as little justification as any other social or political movement now i would say just disclose my past i like black people and i like gay people i'm pro-black and i'm pro-gay i have never once made an argument like in favor of black rights or gay rights on the argument that they are natural or it's due to evolution like we're evolved to embrace gay people and treat them well and give them equal rights or you know the people of different that's ridiculous to me this is political i mean this is real politics let's let's face up to it you know and around the world and throughout history most societies have been intolerant to most people most of the time the most trivial of differences imaginable have brought about unspeakable intolerance meaning catholic versus protestant anyone today can say what the [ __ ] what's the difference in catholic and brought us in are you kidding me you know um portuguese against spanish do you have any idea how hard the portuguese fight against the spanish you know in new orleans and so on you know well the difference meant a lot to them at the time the two most popular ways to try to make politics unquestionable to make you know political authority decisions made by political authorities unquestionable it's either to hide behind the mask of religion or to hide behind the mask of science as i write about my book currently in the 21st century we see you know this other very strange delusion about the law itself that things can't be questioned just because they're a law or just because they're in a constitution as if that's something different than just a decision made by one person at one time that was written down on a piece of paper this strange pattern of thought we have that things become unquestionable when they're called science when they're called religion and the reason why we don't want to admit that it's political is that whatever is political is questionable any decision we make i mean we can we can have a referendum and people decide to make uh abortion completely illegal and then ten years later you have another referendum and they decide to make one portion completely legal from the perspective of the people of saudi arabia we are guilty of a great injustice by depriving people of the freedoms freedoms they want to have within their own religious and cultural tradition right and vice versa we would perceive ourselves as being deprived of the freedoms we would value if we had to go and live in saudi arabia right but the justification the point of policing ultimately is a claim made about potential and i will make the further statement that potential ultimately its significance is intellectual i'm opposed to marijuana everyone in this audience right now i'm just gonna encourage you to quit smoking marijuana never smoke marijuana again if you own marijuana right now in your apartment flush it down the toilet start living a better life tomorrow morning as a result kids it's my position number one some people are dying of cancer some people have particular symptoms either caused by the cancer itself or by the therapy they're receiving such as chemotherapy they're getting chemical treatments and different kinds of invasive okay that are horrendously painful i have been told and i am willing to believe that marijuana can be used to treat the physical pain as a painkiller and has fewer negative side effects than other painkillers for some of these people who are dying of cancer great smoke marijuana every day you're going to die two weeks from now what is the point of me policing your drug habit if you are gonna be dead two weeks from now you see you see how that changes it's subtle but it's not [ __ ] subtle at all it's the most obvious thing in the world and once you've seen it you can't unsee it the justification for me oppressing you whether it's the king oppressing you or the in a democracy the majority oppressing the minority or in a parliamentary system an elite minority oppressing the majority the justification ultimately has to be based on your positive potential or making a claim based on your potential your intellectual potential your human potential okay the shark has absolutely no intellectual potential above and beyond exercising its evolved natural faculties to hunt and kill and mate and lay eggs that's it if you relieve the shark of its duty to hunt and kill by providing it every day with an ingeniously devised vegan sandwich you go every day out in your canoe and you feed the shark a vegan sandwich that the most brilliant scientists have designed to appease the hunger of the sharks so that it no longer has to hunt what do you think you are liberating the shark to do is it now going to write that novel it was working on you know there is no other nature there is no other capacity right there is no further horizon there is no intellectual development possible for the shark it can only be the best shark it can be it cannot imitate a human being in virtue okay it can't cultivate anything intellectually and indeed i think with most predatory species i don't know this about sharks there are some predatory species where if you give them food this way if human beings relieve them they no longer have the need to hunt because they're being fed some of them will just become completely inert some of them will just become lazy they'll do nothing but others will hunt and kill for sport they'll hunt and kill for fun because that's all they know how to do that's all they enjoy they hunting mating they have a very you know they have very very limited intellectual capacity so this is this is obviously taking the more uh i know the less horrifying form of policing as our example right this is policing through deterrence or something right the other form of policing that's being entertained here absurdly and is now endorsed by vegan gains he managed to get that vegan teacher to congressionally go along with it but the other foreign police needs to actually exterminate them because they refuse to live up to our to our human standards our human values when we decide that we are going to police the muslim faith and by the way there are plenty of forms of judaism and christianity that are just as bad i'm not joking in canada you can look at the hutterites a lot of the kind of extreme fundamentalist christian cults frankly let me say look the majority has decided that we do not like the fact that your women are being raised without going to high school and university and so on and i know it's ridiculous because it's not compulsory to go to university but we don't like what you're doing the way you're raising young women in this and we are actually going to start passing laws and we're going to break up your closed cult like community you can imagine there are some mormon groups that are like this too because we really want these women to have access to education and be a part of society and all these in all these different ways ultimately it's about intellectual potential it's like look you are depriving these women of the life of the mind you're depriving them of the full range of their of their human nature their human capabilities but that is the justification for what is genuinely oppressive when you prevent people from circumcising their own children you're oppressing them you prevent people from raising their own sons and daughters the way they want to with their own culture you're oppressing them you're saying yes this oppression is justified because we really believe that you have other potential there's a better life there's a more meaningful life for you to live that you'd be deprived of otherwise okay there is in this way no justification whatsoever for civilized human beings to engage in policing the wilderness policing sharks policing leopards tigers lions and the lion has no other nature no higher intellectual uh characteristics that it can exercise uh develop or ever even imagine or aspire to from my perspective that's a wrap it's simple mod vegan thought that human beings should prevent bears from raping other bears in the forest you know so bears generalizing hashtag not all bears but among bears generally speaking rape is common and cannibalism is also common uh lions too have a great deal of cannibalism yeah it's a dog-eat-dog world it's a very bear world also okay so you have an idea of human morality and like this is specifically human sexuality and you want to impose it on bears you want to police bears you want to police the morality of bears the diet of bears you're going to bring them into court for murder i mean it's for some of us it's just so self-evidently absurd but do you have the vocabulary to reason that through do you have the ability to really explain to someone where it is they're going wrong in applying this this constant policing you would kill every bird on earth because they would dare to to pull a worm from the ground they would dare to crush up a potato bug they would eat the insects out of the air and off the ground you know so you want to you want to commit genocide against robbins we're not living up to your standards this is madness it's madness because you are policing them in a way that that's irrelevant it's it's ridiculous and and by congress you have to talk about what is the positive justification for policing what is the point of policing the point is i'm policing you because i don't want you to become a heroin addict i don't want you to drop out of school and be unemployable and whatever i don't want all these terrible things that happen to you but i'm policing you in a sense also i want you to be vegan i want you to have this more uh sophisticated morally responsible you know view of life so it's filled with i am doing that because of your positive potential when you scale it up our positive potential all right afghanistan could be a better country if they became you know ninety percent atheist and ninety percent vegan you know these things are linked in many ways if you could bring about fundamental positive changes in their in their attitudes their level of education and their outlook on life and so on you could you could radically you know improve life for everyone in that society now how are you going to do it you know obviously we've just seen a 20-year experiment asking the question of can you oppress the people of afghanistan into enlightenment and the answer is george w bush can't i think some other president frankly could have done it i think a lot of this has to be blamed on the unique stupidity of two men george w bush and barack obama well they didn't do it they failed left to their own devices their their culture is going to go on they're going to go on oppressing themselves and oppressing one another and oppressing women and oppressing animals it's going on and on forever and you know the point of policing in this sense you're the catcher the point is ultimately is enlightenment is of wanting people to live an enlightened life and make enlightened choices and become enlightened people become better people that's why i'm telling you to not smoke marijuana i want to tell you also to not use heroin cocaine fentanyl and innumerable other drugs but when we turn to a robin a penguin it's meaningless there is just no sense in which we can preach to the penguins that they ought not to eat fish okay no no no no the hypothetical is they can only use lethal force you're saying it's morally wrong for them to stop a mass shooter who's killing dozens of people if they use lethal force to kill that mass shooter or to stop the mass shooter in my personal opinion it's morally wrong they might do it anyway okay dude this debate over you're a joke to me you know what you're just you're just okay dude you're just [ __ ] special you know what i am done you're just special all right [Music] maybe we can we can practice"},{"id":"e2rq4baZY2g","text":"this is not a live stream about quitting video games so much as it is a live stream talking about giving advice on youtube that nobody wants to hear including coming on youtube and encouraging people to quit video games encouraging people to lead a more meaningful life and uh i've got an email from a fellow youtuber called valshimanov and that's the name of

me an email that i'm going to read out to you here in just a moment i think something most people aren't consciously aware of is that what the vast majority of successful people are doing on youtube is not preaching against something but preaching for something even if what it is they're preaching for is abominably shallow and crass and stupid um the most successful channels dealing with veganism are not the ones that tell you to be vegan they are instead channels that just show off hey here's a beautiful woman in a bikini and there's some implicit level on which this woman is getting it across or letting it be known that the way she maintains her figure the reason why she looks so good in a bikini is because she eats a vegan diet i as you can guess i do not approve of this kind of content i do not watch this kind of content myself and it's very easy to come on youtube thousands of people do this every year to see that kind of success story and then think oh me too i can also put on a bikini i can also put on this kind of performance and i will also have wealth fame money the adoration of the masses now the way i use youtube is very different from other people i'm very often searching for something quite specific that i want to use in a youtube video or just something i'm interested in in real life like lately i've searched within youtube for like los angeles harbor or like you know los angeles vegan restaurant near the harbor or something assumptive just search for something very specific within youtube and that will turn up in the search results examples of channels that in this way were pursuing mainstream success and that had all of the obvious physical and aesthetic features that would bring about this kind of mainstream success and that nevertheless completely failed so you know i could try to remember what it was i was searching for under under different headaches but uh just yesterday there was one channel and the the woman on camera was completely gorgeous blonde in the prime of her life and the only video she had that had any views at all was one of these try on haul videos where the thumbnail was showing her like 90 naked try on and you know yeah a small percentage of the viewers who click on that are interested in the clothes you're wearing i think you know these women they talk about the clothes they've been buying and a large percent of them are men who are interested looking at your your largely naked body i i don't know i don't know why anyone does this on youtube i mean is it people who are like at the office and like their their boss at work only lets their computer go to certain types of websites because if you want to look at naked women on the internet there are websites other than youtube they're devoted to that but it seems there's still a huge huge mark of this but it was a completely gorgeous young woman and um uh you know there were palm trees in the background sort of all the all the shallow things you associate with uh with the successful youtube channel and she has a boyfriend and the boyfriend has exactly the kind of beard that's in fashion in 2021 this sort of you know fashionable beautiful couple and i would assume they are consciously rather than unconsciously imitating the success of other youtube channels and other other instagram uh models or what have you and the videos on this channel had 11 views 22 views 50 views like video by video this was not even successful amongst you know your this person's own friend group uh because you know your friends and family and people you've known on facebook for 20 years or something those add up to quite a few views if you're kind of a normal person who's been on social media since the day you were born which in 2021 is is most people uh you know my my point here being that um the vast majority of successful youtube channels are not preaching sobriety are not preaching hard work are not preaching quitting video games right they're just showing you a beautiful person climbing a mountain or a beautiful person uh swimming in the ocean on vacation in the azores islands or whatever the example is they're showing you beautiful people doing beautiful things and then at some point there's a hook where they try to sell you their their lifestyle package they try to rope the audience into to imitating them right now there's a much smaller number of uh youtube channels that are instead giving an explicitly negative message and now that message takes many forms but it might be for example someone saying that hey they used to be an alcoholic don't be an alcoholic don't waste your life the same way they did someone coming on camera saying they used to be a drug addict someone coming on camera saying they used to be a video game addict or someone coming on camera and just saying hey they squandered positive opportunities in their life because of what it was they were doing once in a while i've seen hit videos which is someone just coming on talking about how he ruined his life by cheating on his girlfriend you know once in a while you see this where it's an explicitly negative message saying don't be like me and then there's the hook right then there's the hook is instead imitate my my positive uh lifestyle the number of successful examples of that the number of examples that find an audience is very small and again you can search for it i often do you can search within youtube for any particular topic like that you're going to find the vast majority of those or videos that only reach that person's own friends and family that reach this very very small uh you know audience so just say this is you know part of the overall insanity of social media is that even if the message you have to deliver is fundamentally negative if you are giving advice that nobody wants to hear most you are doing it by packaging it in a form or it seems like it's presenting you with something you do want to hear right i mean fundamentally outside of a religious context it's very very hard to gather an audience to keep an audience or to earn money out of commanding the attention of an audience by telling people that they things that they don't want to hear and i think all of us no matter what culture you're from you're influenced by the pulpit you're influenced by the religious format of preaching and by the way i used to be a scholar of buddhism i am not just talking about christian culture i'm not just talking about muslim culture or jewish culture growing up in a buddhist context you grew up in a place like thailand or something too you are familiar with preaching you were familiar with what it is to have people you know trying to trying to change your change your way of living yeah i remember i knew on i think i've told this story before five years ago or something i knew one very passionate but very stupid uh buddhist monk who spoke english with a with a thick accent and that's what he was saying oh you gotta change your way on living everything he said in english was grammatically wrong but it was very passionate it was very sincere and he would always remember he wouldn't tell people to stop eating meat he would say oh you cut meat you cannot cut meat you have to stop cutting me and i don't know if it was intentional i don't know if his mind is a buddhist monk it was the act of cutting meat that caused bad karma rather than eating meat but the his episode was to cut meat was an evil act as opposed to buying it or eating it you know oh no you gotta change your way of living you cut meat oh you drink alcohol [Laughter] now sorry just to close the loop on on that even in the buddhist context of men wearing buddhist robes allegedly living in celibacy allegedly eating only two meals per day you know they're different strictures and buddhism allegedly never wearing shoes it's very controversial in each buddhist country depending on which monastic order you sign up with the rules for when you can and cannot wear shoes are different but it's interesting it's not that interesting another one is actually whether or not you shave your eyebrows that's the difference between the different disorders do you just shave your head or do you shave your eyebrows also you'll notice these things the buddhist monks distinguish themselves you know so people who are in the know could tell oh i could i can tell you with the cm nikaya because you shave your eyebrows you can tell which which monastic word there was um once you get involved in buddhism you may be shocked and horrified at the extent to which it operates very much like youtube instagram social media i was shocked really shocked when i saw a particular poster in thailand for the first time which was a buddhist monk he was a very skinny old man in a robe and he was literally pouring out a bag full of gold coins and what it said in thai approximately was like basically like if you pray to me or if you worship me you will never lack money like you'll always have plenty of money this is just just you see this completely shamelessly in in buddhism in thailand just straight up if you donate money to the buddhist church you'll get rich like donate money to buddhist monks and magically the good karma will come back to you and and you'll get wealthy um you know remember a sermon that i heard it's not worth telling the whole story i wasn't in the temple but a lot of temples they have a microphone and loudspeakers and sermon was just like oh you know uh people say they're too busy to come to the temple and you know but if you you know if you come to the temple and you do meditation and you do prayer and you donate money to the to the temple you know good good things will happen to you you'll get money you'll get rich you'll find a new beautiful woman yeah this kind of promise of good karma bring good things into your life so yeah i mean down to and including getting laid like improve your sex life look better in a bikini through buddhist virtue you would be surprised and you might be appalled at the extent to which you know even in a buddhist monastic context things start to resemble the social media influencers method okay so just to say a little bit about val this guy valerie shimanov he is doing youtube videos in his second language you can imagine how much harder it would be for me to record youtube videos in chinese or in french or in german in any language in english but if you can put up with his accent he does have some interesting ideas here and there in these videos and he's giving a consistently negative message he talks about the ways in which his own past playing video games ruined his life and then he talks about positively why you have to quit video games you know the importance of quitting videos the mentality of the video game addict and how to overcome it to give you an example that i thought was really meaningful and i drew my girlfriend's attention to it and then i played it he had an observation in a recent video where he just said you know people who play video games tell themselves that they're building up their problem-solving skills you know that they're learning how to solve problems they're making themselves more intelligent or more effective people through through problem solving but in real life you don't have these kinds of predefined problems where there's a right and a wrong answer or there's one way out of the maze you know the type of problems you're facing in video games in a really profound way profound and not necessarily obvious way they're totally different from the way problem solving works in real life anyway he doesn't say a lot more about that he says this brief observation that um no the problem-solving skills you're practicing video games are radically incompatible with problem solving anyway i i paused the video and i said to melissa i said to my girlfriend here i said it's so true you know in real life your problem is like you're sitting on the couch with your boyfriend and you're unhappy and you don't know why you know you're waking up and going to your job and you hate your job and you don't know what the problem is and you don't know what to do about it like you you whatever you wake up and you you have a pile of books you haven't read or something like there's there's no particular problem with a particular solution in life you want to jump in yeah i was just going to say yesterday i was watching a walkthrough of an old nes game it was literally just like you have to follow the circle the right well you know i remember saying to my my old friends i had a friend named jamie smith he's now a university professor i've invited him to come on the channel and he never will he's the guy who knew me when i was a kid i've always thought that would be interesting i don't know if you guys would too i mean thumbs up if you think that would be interesting i think it would be interesting for me to be in a dialogue with like via skype presumably wouldn't be someone who knew me before all this [ __ ] i mean before i had a shaved head even you know what i mean before someone who knew what a scumbag i was before you know before i got in the path of righteousness in my ebook [Laughter] before i became fully enlightened as you can be too for 1999 before i started doing 200 push-ups a day buy my ebook learn how to do 200 push-ups today eat my diet do my push-up regimen anyway uh i remember talking to my my friend and uh my my ex-friend he was we were friends while we were kids this was uh after i had finished my ba but he hadn't finished his yet so toward the end of the university time period um and uh he said something positive about some video game he was addicted to at the time i told civilization four or so whatever some video game at that time it was some video he wasn't ashamed of playing that's why i suggested a civilization iv because it was one of those games as opposed to oh yeah pictures of women with big breasts bouncing up and down which is a lot of video games but i think it was something slightly more erudite that he didn't feel embarrassed saying he was addicted to and uh but anyway he mentioned a couple video games he'd been addicted to in recent years and i said at that time i was playing no video games at all video games were not a part of my life at all whereas today they have a small part of my life partly because i have a daughter blah blah and um i said to him you know this whole process of playing a video game it's just like a lion tamer holding up a hoop and saying jump through the hoop and then the next level they're holding the hoop a little higher or the whole little further away or now there are two hoops for you to jump through but this this issue of you know problem solving these predefined problems and what was interesting so this is for me this is not a very interesting observation like of course it's obvious a video game is created by a human being as a series of problem-solving challenges like a human being is in the position of a lion theme right what was interesting to me was that he was completely baffled about this he had never thought of using what what do you mean like he really was shocked to hear this this was totally alien to totally different from his his way of thinking about video games and about his own life you know but anyway the next phase of that argument the point i was raising with the question is you know but if you do this like you're engaged in a process of training but what is it that you are in the process of training yourself to do you know and and like you know there is a skill set it's just a completely useless skill set mario 64 uh zelda like whatever example we're gonna use like you know oh yeah you get really good at you know some of the puzzle games you get really good at matching up these [ __ ] puzzle pieces but it has it has no connection to anything you can ever use in real life it also doesn't have any connection to any redeeming moral intellectual qualities like moral quality intellectual qualities emotional qualities doesn't make you a better person in any of those ways no by the way i'm skeptical about about claims of what kind of exercises could but i mean you can imagine at least i mean if you're actually doing math problems you're getting better at math there's somebody but you're not doing math problems you know yeah right shout out to donkey kong math the only educational game on the nintendo entertainment system there was one other there were only two educational games on the nes donkey kong math and there's one in japanese involving popeye it's pretty much like popeye learns the alphabet but it's in japanese it's not nice you want to say this no i just how would this translate into your life like oh okay if you reach this stage if you if you get through this hoop then get like this is how you view life like it's it's just not right well and i think what what val is into is pointing out the ways you know the ways in which this actually has a corrosive effect in your life because that is that is the type of goal orientation you have that is the type of problem-solving mentality you have instead of the type of problem-solving uh you know mentality one ought to have which again like look so you know just to talk about my own life briefly we'll come back to val we'll come back to quitting videos talk back to as you say the fundamental topic of this video is not quitting video games but giving people advice they don't want to hear on youtube with video games being a great example you know um when i finished high school i just mentioned the high school i went to was bad i didn't go to a good high school um and everyone had built up my education supported me everyone had built up my expectations that the quality of education at university would be higher and i was just devastated when i got to university the university i went to was back i got to university and everything was worse so like you know you're in high school you're like okay this is the quality of education i'm getting this is terrible but everyone's telling me just put up with it just tolerate it because just in a couple years you're gonna get to university and then this is gonna be wonderful then it gets university and it's abominably terrible like i can really see the ways in which university education in this particular circumstance that it's worse than what i had in high school you know what's the problem what's the solution like you are just sitting there on your couch in my case i was sitting on the floor i didn't have a couch those are my years of not having any furniture when i just sit on the floor and sleep on the floor but i'm sitting on the floor thinking what the hell am i supposed to do now you know so that's mostly thinking about the professors and the courses and and also my own future like what am i going to do with the rest of my life because it's not a short-term problem that's incredibly long-term implications now look everyone also assured me that when i went to university there'd be lots of brilliant intelligent people unlike my high school and by the way there were some brilliant people in my high school like amongst the students there were because high school was a random sample of the population right and and some of the brilliant people in high school were poor and some of them didn't finish high school you know some of them were you know strong characters who didn't want to submit to authority and who you know defied the teachers and you know but i met all kinds of brilliant strong-willed people in high school and now i get to university and everyone is stupider and everyone is shallower like what's the problem what am i going to do so sorry melissa i think the the example you're using was it's that old nes game uh a tropic oh god the tropical island game and the sequel is called revenge of zoda star tropics star tropics shout out to star tropics anyway and like the nature of star trek is okay you walk into a room there is a closed door you could either go this way or like you know this completely predefined puzzle with the beginning of the limited solution and it's presented to you it's self evident to you this is the problem this is the room you're in this is the door you need to go through right in real life there is no door there is no objective there is you know you are just sitting there like wow everyone lied to me you know including my parents and my parents went through university not even in the 1960s i think the 19 like sorry there's a big gap between my my mother's younger than my father but anyway they went back they went to university in a different world like you know to what extent they were intentionally lying to me to what extent it was rose-colored glasses about their childhood and to what extent it just reflected what universities were like in the 1940s this is a this is just different you know oh it just just doesn't apply so you know here i am sitting there is no you know the level doesn't start the level doesn't end there is no door there is no puzzle there is no solution this is your life what are you gonna do homeboy and look and i just i just want to say i mean i i think i have alluded this before i had several years when i was in university when i was in the ba where i was overtly suicidal where it was that bad where it's like you know i don't know what i'm going to do with the rest of my life with this crushing disappointment and the burden on me of trying to do something about it i'm you know i'm not saying this was some minor trivial thing i'm laughing about it now i wasn't laughing then and nobody helped me and nobody made it better i went and talked to a psychiatrist i was a psychiatrist on the campus didn't have [ __ ] to say he had no way to help me there's nothing i've said before there is no professional help it's like yeah guess what i don't have a psychological problem i have a real life problem i don't have an emotional problem this is a real [ __ ] problem bro and you know again you're you know it's just it's just radically radically compatible with the world view that's brought on by by playing video games if you play those games when you're a child you'll remember the order in which you're supposed to so when you're a child you have this opportunity to learn the steps or like problem solving skills that you can apply to your real life but instead a lot of children are learning it through this you're memorizing this stuff in video games it stays there forever yeah well when you read about ancient cultures too um you know it may seem surprising or difficult to believe all these children in china memorized these classical texts you know all these children in india memorized the whole text of the vedas within buddhism they they memorized this poetry from buddhism stuff yeah you can memorize literature the same way by the way we still memorize songs many people growing up you memorize all the lyrics to a whole series of pop songs but yeah you will you are memorizing things in video games that are at best useless to you but at worst you know actually harmful okay just gonna turn to the comments in the audience for a second yeah so close says i don't know where close is that close says quote in my country people shame you if you play video games and you're an adult man good i mean i just mentioned you know like you know we we believe i'm saying we just meaning melissa and i i'm not speaking for a larger movement i really do believe in progress through shame i think a lot of forms of social progress and personal progress come through shame and you know frankly when you talk to people in positions of authority uh someone like university professor very often shame is the only lever you have to use in them you can say them look aren't you ashamed you know are you ashamed this is oh shout out to common sense skeptic there's a there's a guy who's addicted to video games comments common sense skeptic what up tell me what is the last video game you played skeptic you know i'm getting that vibe from you that you did some kind of boring math or engineering degree and you know i mean either when you went through university you were addicted to video games or it was cocaine that's the vibe i'm getting for you uh there's a famous um a medical doctor who gives advice about psychology and he's a very harsh critic of drugs like prozac his name is peter bregen so he's famous for basically telling people look solve your problems in real life with your emotions don't take prozac don't take this that's generally his his approach that's that's what he's famous for and uh he has an anecdote i'm sure he's told it at many different lectures that he once gave a lecture like this and he was giving a comparison between getting addicted to psychiatric medication solving problems and getting addicted to cocaine you know so you could imagine somewhat amusing anecdote and then the lecture ends and he said a man stood up from the audience and this was a very erudite audience where pretty much everyone had a phd everyone was either a psychiatrist or a psychotherapist or some kind of researcher at university and a man got up the audience furious at him walked up to him as he came down from the podium and he said how dare you say that about cocaine if it weren't for cocaine i would have never worked my way through graduate school and he turned around and walked out serious this guy was like saying like he would have never finished medical school without cooking now why do i tell this this now uh to be fair i don't hear anyone speaking that positively about video games like i know and that guy was not joking and i can imagine a friend of a friend i won't say who this is i have a female friend who slept with the lead singer of a famous band a famous music group and um that guy talked to her openly about the fact that like one of their albums it was a hit album they made it would have never been recorded without cocaine said the way that cocaine brought everyone together and got them focused i mean it's a stimulant drug you know that in terms of that you said that album wouldn't and then i think it was their last album or their last successful album and then the band fell apart so you know no i'm i'm against cocaine don't don't do cocaine say no to drugs in case you haven't seen my other videos i'm not but i would just mention i don't know anything that positive that comes out of video games like the sense in which there's something positive to be said about taking coffee taking adderall taking stimulants or whatever i've never even seen i've never i don't think anyone would even say as a joke that they wouldn't have finished medical school or they wouldn't have finished graduate school or something uh without without playing video games because it's such a negative drain on your life anyway so common sense skeptic says he personally worked through jobs to get through school well he said he had he had three jobs you see so that's the kind of [ __ ] you are you're one of those resentful blue-collar hard-working [ __ ] you're one of those i earned this [ __ ] and you will you will never be the kind of cool relaxed aristocrat that i am who can just openly say my parents paid for [ __ ] okay [ __ ] [ __ ] you and you're through [ __ ] you just just stay on topic uh you know my parents when i was a kid were poor they were flat broke when i was a kid and that relates to the fact that my father had nine kids so he got so many women pregnant whatever but it doesn't just it also relates to the fact that my parents had been communists subject for another video but my parents were not moderate communists they were extremists so even other communists considered them crazy they were really pro-mass murderer type extremist communists so naturally during that time of their life they did not earn a lot of money my dad had a bunch of kids and he had a bunch of cult-like beliefs this is a pretty reliable um formula for poverty anyway then i guess like right at the end of my time in high school no no be honest i was gonna say they started getting money in my last year of high school really they didn't have money to spend until i was in university i was in university for years and years felt like a long time and it was a long time that i was at university they started having money to spend while i was in a ba and again see there's another cause of poverty all my brothers and sisters are older than me so they were paying for my older sister's tuition and at least one of my older brothers at the time maybe two was also going to university so they were paying a lot of money that way so they only started having money to burn while i was a university student and still they had all these all these impositions on them but then beyond that there's your parents own attitude like however much or however little money your parents have are they willing to spend it to support you and when i started university my parents had the worst [ __ ] attitude which was of no you should go and work 40 hours a week at starbucks and i did that in my first year university and it almost ruined my whole education and ruined my whole life so i was working at starbucks and some days you have to wake up at 5 30 in the morning to do the opening shift and some days you have to work until past midnight to do the closing shift and it made it completely impossible to learn anything at a university completely impossible and my parents did not give a [ __ ] so i had the experience for one year i think something like that a year and three months some of that of working at starbucks while being university student and i was living at home with my parents i didn't have an apartment i wasn't paying rent or something and i wasn't living in university uh in residence wasn't living in a dorm and you know at some point i just had to turn to my parents and say look this is this is ridiculous like you know there there is no point in me going to university at all i just had to rebel against them and that was a source of conflict and hatred and resentment between me and my parents for like 20 years like sorry at least 15 years later you know i could figure out how many years it was i remember this is before my father i remember my mother still attacking me for this that i had somehow betrayed the family or let them down by quitting my job at starbucks instead of dropping out of university to just work at starbucks full-time like that was how [ __ ] up and demented my parents were about like the value of education versus the value of a minimum wage job what's supposedly a part-time job but it takes over your whole life so anyway yeah and um in that same period as i mentioned my parents started having money to burn so you know my mom bought a fur coat literally my father bought a new car like there were all these signs they started going on vacation to exotic places and stuff it's like dude if you have money for a fur coat and a car it does not make sense for me to ruin my education really ruin the rest of my life by dropping out of university to work for a minimum wage at a coffee shop so it was a big it was a big call but i saw i saw both sides of that but yes whether you are at cambridge university or oxford or the university of toronto um there is a certain kind of [ __ ] character that's formed by these guys who worked three part-time jobs well while putting themselves through school so yeah whether that's better or worse than being a video game addict or a cocaine addict is definitely an interesting topic for discussion uh common sense skeptics says when the we came out they had a series of games called rock band and we bought the full kit melissa will you get the the balance board for me we we have a nintendo wii and the only game we ever use it for is we fit so a couple days ago the gym was too full i i'm we fit is all right man it's like oh there's some quality hardware you know yeah we have uh wii fit if you want to do push-ups with a computer counting the number of push-ups you're doing so we we do own a wii and i've carried it all around the world for my for my daughter so my daughter used to play kirby with me on that wii and we have the balance board i don't know if we'll still be able to own this we may have to throw this stuff in the garbage next time we move apartments but anyway he says on the wii there was a game called rock band and we bought the full kit drums keyboards guitar and it carried five people at a time so that's i never i never heard of that so obviously that's some kind of simulated you know instrument game you know rhythm game or whatever so they go well showed it to the nintendo wii and uh they played the instance in time but then uh well that's it so he was saying there is some uh educational value but obviously they were already trained musicians uh playing the playing the games together okay so i'm going to read now and respond to this email from val there's a link to val in the description of el shimanov dear eisel hello exclamation point thank you for commenting on one of my videos i just sent him a comment saying hey i'm glad to see you're uploading videos again he paused for some months or a better part of the year i think yeah i quote i truly respect your dedication to the work you do on your channel and your consistency with your project you raise a lot of complicated issues that few people have the courage to bring up i've also noticed more streams and longer content on your channel and that is great i also thank you for the stream of subscribers maybe 50 to 75 people that started following my channel after you posted a video with a link to my channel a year ago when i just started right so as mentioned you can follow the link in this channel too uh quote i would also like to share with you one of my thoughts which bothers my mind after spending some time studying the video game addiction issue i found that it is almost useless to confront gamers with the idea that negatively viewing video games no matter how okay so again english is a second language it's a little bit confusing it is almost useless to confront gamers with a negative view of video games no matter how logical and obvious the arguments against video games are most gamers are simply not mature enough to understand the importance of other values in life so i'm going to pause here so you see this is both the strength and the weakness of the bikini youtuber right so what i do inexorably appeals to a small audience because i'm out here saying hey this is what it is to lead a meaningful life who's with me again and again again i have my own very definite sense of what it means to lead a meaningful life i have a very definite sense of what it means to be a man right and some people respond to that positively i think it's noteworthy that a lot of the people who respond to apostles come out of a patriarchal religious background so they're people who are today atheists but were born and raised hindu they're people who are today atheists but they were born and raised muslim or eastern orthodox christian or something i'm aware of this you know i used to use this hashtag bronze age values there is an overt mcchismo to my videos to what i'm saying about life there there is a you know in in the parliaments of our times there is this man up aspect to what i do where i'm saying be a real man and that applies to you know things like reading books and caring about your education how you develop intellectually yeah it you know relates to questions of ethics and politics and so on too and you know by contrast what i do uh it's extremely unappealing too and quite rebarbative to uh the stereotypical left wing in 2021 the vast majority of left-wing people back when i was making videos talking about bernie sanders they pick up on it and there are people who think i'm right-wing or think i'm conservative just because of the mckiswan you know i get that kind of response where people can just tell aesthetically somehow um you know this is incompatible with the alexandria ocasio-cortez supporting left of the 21st century now hashtag spoilers if you don't know politically i have a lot more in common with bernie sanders than i have in common with donald trump if you actually watch my videos that becomes that becomes obvious um you know where i am on exactly on the left to right spectrum now is is hard to say but you know very fundamentally i do care about government caring i care about government helping the poor i care about government being by the poor and for the poor and of the poor and one of the deepest and most important differences between left and right is just in this sense classism the extent to which the right wing and the conservatives are activists for of the aristocratic class and the left wing at least pretends to engage in advocacy for the poor and downtrodden disadvantage so there are many fundamental ways in which i am left of center if not left-wing um but my point is this you know if you are a beautiful woman wearing a bikini and you are making videos that implicitly or explicitly say hey you can be a beautiful woman in a bikini like me if you live my lifestyle buy my ebook pay for my training course eat my diet emulate me right there's a positive message there that very often doesn't have to be you know explicitly stated even even someone like kell even a test bag of course obviously but who i think i'm thinking of the girl who went crazy and deleted her youtube channel s and o'neill essen o'neill great example you know essen o'neill shows you how she exercises shows you her diet her youtube channel is deleted now she became massively wealthy and famous this way right where the positive message and and the youtuber being a role model it's there really very powerfully and then that becomes a kind of packaging for what's ultimately a very negative message because the negative message is hey you yeah you most of what you're doing in your life is bad and even wrong like hey you you should be ashamed of yourself well like that's that's there too right but it's it's packaged in the appealing bikini body message you know so now what i'm doing is not a bikini body message and i literally do get email asking me about my diet and exercise regimen all right i now do uh over 200 push-ups a day and i weigh over 220 pounds and i do push-ups with my my feet elevated so for a man who is in his mid-40s i am in okay shape and by the way i try to spend too much time at the gym i don't want to spend three hours a day at the gym there are all these things i have other priorities like reading this stack of books here i'm learning languages and studying politics and being a filmmaker and being an author writing a book there's all this stuff the life of the mind imposes on my time in a huge way but in a short amount of time i want to get a lot of exercise at the gym so believe it or not even on that level there are people who relate to me that way there are people who are in their mid 40s and they're in much worse physical shape than i am the guy who was writing i think he's still in his 20s the guy who wrote me this long series of requests asking about exactly what i eat in my diet um so i just say they're not all they're not all older guys i get younger guys trading i do not get young women in bikinis right for this advice um but you know there are there are men who respond to it that way the point is here uh what i am offering positively is profoundly out of step with their times that's why i used to say you know bronze age values i'm presenting a bronze age vision of of masculinity you know and um a very very small percentage of people are going to relate to when i'm what i'm offering positively that way now you know who should we compare this to look at the total degenerates uh who have been so you know successful on uh on youtube look at vaush look at uh hassan abby uh who's the other one thinking of oh god oh yeah the guy he just used the name destiny several people using the name destiny um all these guys play video games right so you know i mean in terms of a masculine role model i mean you look at vaush and you you think people want to be like vaush you know it's just you really you want to grow up to be like this guy like whether you're a younger person or you're an older guy trying to turn your life around you want to be like vaush really you know hassan hassan pike or hassan abby it's recently been drawn attention to or discovered that he sleeps with prostitutes he admitted sleeping with prostitutes and paying to go to a brothel and this kind of thing and that does fit into his political philosophy he's a left-winger who believes that sex work is work so on and so forth a guy like destiny the guy is and by the way all these people play video games all these people live a life of just reckless pointless self-indulgence i mean sorry hassan abby he is a multi-millionaire he can sit there and do a video game live stream from a left-wing perspective complaining about how migrant workers have a hard time well you aren't actually going out and even interviewing the migrant workers like just as a journalist you can just go talk to them about their lives but you could also help them because you are literally a multi-millionaire at this point you've gotten rich by sharing your moral opinions of the world you have the opportunity to make a difference in this and there's just no no positive motivation so yeah i wasn't even getting into that but right sam walsh writes in oh welcome back sam sam's a regular viewer uh sam says quote destiny takes drugs too he mistakenly took a drug that he thought was mdma but it turned out to be meth or something similar yes so i mean the role of drugs alcohol video games self-indulgence the way these guys live their uh sex lives and let me just say i judge everybody this way i judge my own father this way like dude the decisions you made about your sex life they matter they still count my father got a fully paid scholarship he was poor by the way as a kid as my as a kid my father was poor came from a single parent family his mother's job was literally in a steel factory in a shitty steel manufacturing town in canada like he was poor and uh he as he tells the story his father uh abandoned them i think i think my grandfather had a different perspective on that but regardless uh you know my father got a fully paid scholarship to get a phd studying hindu philosophy studying hinduism at the harvard school of world religion he never stopped eating meat how can you be serious about hinduism without being at least some kind of vegetarian i judge you okay like sorry bro my dad's dead now yeah i judge you you know i mean my father got all these different women pregnant he wasn't positively involved in any of his children's lives he wasn't possibly involved in my life you know i judge you bro you know these things go napoleon bonaparte you know i judge him including by his sex life it tells you a lot about who somebody is as a man so yeah the um yeah all these people i'm just saying these these are examples of people who started off in the same place i did like not even not that many years ago i think i mean three years ago i think vaush wasn't famous yet like it's the last three years or so he's moved up i can remember when hassan was a nobody that's maybe more like five years ago but all these guys they just came on the internet and talked about politics and talked about their feelings talk about their lives those guys i don't think you've seen a single book review out of them like sorry i am making the effort i am reading by several books right now i am all the time reading and then making youtube videos where i'm doing book reviews and i'm writing a book i'm actively growing as a person someone like hassan abby just sits back passively and talks about what happens to be on the news this week different kind of thing but um you know okay my point is why did they grow their audience in this way i think it is precisely because people look at them and they see a model of manhood and a model of adulthood that they can aspire to emulate now just give the example if you don't might as well type if you don't know who freely is you might assume the audience for freely is men who masturbate looking at pictures of her in a bikini men who are turned on by looking at her nearly nude it's not the audience for freely is women who look at her as a model of what they can aspire to be that's partly that's just her body there are women who watch this and they want to emulate her diet and exercise and have a similar kind of body partly it's also the spirituality the politics the lifestyle you know freely you know her currently her organic farming regimen right her gardening regimen uh frk fully raw christina you know i'm not gonna say zero percent of christina's audience is men who masturbate watching these videos but she's got a lot of competition for that market there are a lot of places you can go on the internet to masturbate you know um you know no in the bulk of her audience is people who look up to her as a lifestyle model as something to be emulated you know now again sir i've already said this is true of my own audience it's a small audience but it's a passion of people i get all kinds of emails from people saying how i help them turn their lives around i am a father figure to several hundred people or a couple thousand people and i've been an influence in their lives in that way for a lot of people i'm the stern demanding uncompromising father figure that points his finger at you and says no that's not good enough the excuses you're making don't make sense you know man up and they get out of it whatever they they get out of it you know so i'm aware this this critique applies to me also but i'm saying what i represent positively the model of a meaningful life i represent and i give voice to right there's an incredibly tiny audience who can appreciate that and respond to that possibly as opposed to a bikini youtuber as opposed to someone like vaush hassan or destiny right as opposed to someone who's just living a drugged up self-indulgent dissipated degenerate life right so this is one of the ways in which you have to criticize your own position especially if the message you have to deliver is fundamentally negative you know especially if the message you have to deliver is you know what you're doing is not good enough you know you have to quit video games you have to stop making excuses you have to stop doing childish things in your life so on and so forth you have to have some kind of higher or more positive aspiration um and obviously sorry so i'm responding here to an email from val part of val's problem is that of course he doesn't represent anything positive that way i mean you may think you know he mentions i think he has four children now you know as a wife and kids you know so he can try to represent himself as like a positive role model just in that he has a job and a family that's a very different kind of youtubing right so you'd have to look up a youtube channel like family fizz you know you really want to do that you really want to show youtube videos like hey this is me with my wife and kids and we're so we're so happy again sorry in each of these categories the vast majority of people fail the vast majority of people who try to be a family youtuber like family fizz this is me with my kids going to disneyland the vast majority never get 500 regular viewers the vast majority of people who try to be like freely or fully pardon me or fully raw christina or test bag the vast majority fail never get 500 viewers even if they're gorgeous even if they're incredibly sexy and appealing in other ways they're they're incredibly athletic the vast majority felt the vast majority of former olympic athletes male and female who start a youtube channel never get 500 uh of views and let me be clear the vast majority of people who try to be vouch the vast viewer people who try to be hassan abby the vast droid people who try to miss the vast majority of them fail right now there are more meaningful questions asked there like do you want to succeed do you want to live this life is this who you want to be and if you do this what kind of person are you going to be five years from now like there's a lot more to say about that there are a lot of reasons to not imitate the bikini youtubers or vaush or what have you um apart from the question of success or failure but at this moment we're talking which is reaching an audience and changing the world in this specific way of getting across a fundamentally negative message of telling people that the life they're leading right now is meaningless and what they're doing is bad and evil and wrong which is a huge part of the message i have to deliver to the world so guys if you haven't seen that look i could stop now and read this read this email out but i had a guy right into me if you follow me on patreon if you support the channel on patreon for one dollar a month you will have already seen this but i had a guy right into me um saying that he regularly uses the addictive drug ketamine and that he's uh he's writing a book now about this drug out so there's the link to it sorry i just says i didn't write a lengthy introduction to what that link shows you if you click on that link you'll see that this guy wrote me this letter and i write back to him very aggressively calling him a crackhead and telling him to get his life together and stop making excuses this is this is a level of stern rebuke and reproach that he would never get from a christian preacher i doubt he would get this from a muslim imam i doubt he would get this from a buddhist monk or a or a hindu leader now and after he gets uh okay look i'll read this up so i'm just saying this is this is delivering a message this is telling people something they do not want to hear he justifies his own drug use and justifies other people taking this addictive hallucinogenic drug by saying that they are fundamentally unhappy uh with their lives but changing their lives is more difficult than just just getting on the drug you know this is to summarize his message and i write back to him and say [ __ ] period i wasn't happy with my life period i moved to laos i learned the lotion language i learned a whole hell of a lot more than that what kind of condition was i in five years later in what way did i benefit grow or change from that challenge take a look at yourself adam you've got a drug habit you've got brain damage and you've got the excuses you made for it where are you going to be five years from now dead you're going to be a brain damaged dried up pathetic shell of a man just five years from now like all the other prescriptions psych med junkies and what condition could you be in today if you'd made a very different decision four years ago and you'd moved to laos learned la ocean did humanitarian work did some kind of research etc what kind of man would you be today that man will never exist it's already game over for you period you're trapped in a living death and you don't even know it yet period so again just to buzz your your christian preacher is never going to say this to you your buddhist monkeys never your parents are never gonna say this to you your brother your girlfriend your wife not even your ex-wife after you break up we'll say this to you we'll say to you you are going to die if you keep using this drug and you are already trapped in a living death and you have already squandered or lost your opportunity to live a meaningful life and become a better person all right that is real talk he isn't paying me doing this for free but you know this is really giving people advice they don't want to hear this is telling somebody something they don't hear this guy doesn't just use this drug he's currently writing and publishing a book encouraging other people to use this drug to solve their psychological problems right okay it is already game over for you period you're trapped in a living death and you don't even know it yet and by the way i do not regard moving to laos as a positive example it's a terrible idea and a negative example but it's still better than what you've signed up for so you guys can click on the link and read the whole correspondence because it goes several several messages long but i just point out after the next message he sends to me which is a defensive message naturally enough what i say back is this me replying to him again i say prove me wrong crackhead you want to lead a meaningful life you want to make the world a better place it starts with sobriety it starts with self-discipline by all means prove me wrong take that manuscript for a pro book you wrote and burn it turn your back on all the excuses in the pages of that book and turn your back on all the excuses you lived by but were too ashamed to set down in writing quitting the drug will be easier than quitting the excuses you've made for it prove me wrong tough guy so i'm just reading that to make it clear it is obvious in a sense that you know i am trying to help him like i'm not just calling you a crackhead for no reason and not just saying you're already dead i'm saying hey oh oh oh you disagree okay great then get motivated get sober start doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do um [Music] so anyway again you can click on the link if you want to see because he writes back again and i reply again right and i'm keeping it all the way real but look you know okay you want to do what i do you want to give people advice they don't want to hear you can make so much money and have so much fame and wealth if you just give people advice that they do want to hear if you tell people what they already want to hear if you tell people what they're already doing is great and wonderful right if you're just encouraging them encouraging them in their bad habits right you can make all kinds of money you can have all kinds of wealth and fame and success right if you just come up with that the great the great left-wing message of the 21st century you do you do your own thing be yourself be happy do whatever makes you happy oh good for you you go girl you know if you come out with that [ __ ] okay now you're telling people things they do want to hear when you're really keeping it real with people this way you know think about it think well think about what your own expectations are why should anyone put up with that why should anyone pay me for me to tell them they're a [ __ ] crackhead who's ruined their life why would you pay me for that why even the the exercise stuff like you know look i can set up a website i can start doing coaching like if you want this level of honesty and coaching they want to pay me a hundred dollars to have me coach them doing push-ups basically i'm just going to tell you you're a lazy piece of [ __ ] like well if there's no art to it there's no science to it you have to you have to do it right you just have to actually [ __ ] do it admit there's a little bit of advice you can give people about you know i'm sorry melissa no i melissa couldn't lift five pounds we got together i've given melissa her whole gym and exercise yeah i remember i remember you couldn't do an arm curl with five pounds and now yesterday you did 20 push-ups but when melissa and i got together she could not do one push-up she had no she had no upper body strength or lower body strength she wasn't amazingly poor and she'd never exercise in her life and i showed her how to use weights and i showed you this stuff so i have a little bit of experience training someone uh to have you know fundamental core strength now now she can go from 20 push-ups to 200 push-ups she can catch up with me although with each push-up she's raising a lot less weight than i am because i weigh a hell of a lot but anyway look like you know i can't expect people to pay me for exercise advice or diet advice when what i have to say is you're a terrible person you know who is go and again we have a cultural expectation because our religions christianity judaism islam hinduism like buddhism a lot of them are based on a patriarchal figure a you know a priest a buddhist monk whatever standing there and telling you that what you're doing is bad and evil and wrong that you're a terrible person that you're not living up to the standards and people pay them they get money and fame and respect right it's it's a remarkable incongruous thing so it's somewhat natural to have that bleed over into our expectations for for social media so let me give you a great example we have 41 people in the audience right now and only 18 of you have hit thumbs up so the rest of you are sitting there just fuming the rest of you so why didn't more of you hit thumbs up maybe now we have 42 people maybe it's because you really don't appreciate me telling you what a lazy piece of [ __ ] you maybe if you are watching vosh maybe if you were watching destiny maybe if you were watching freely the banana girl or fully rock christina telling you that you were a wonderful person hi guys thanks for tuning in i'm so glad you joined me today you know you guys light up my life it makes me so happy to sit here and talk to you [ __ ] losers who i would never meet up with for coffee in real life not even if you paid me hit that share like and subscribe button like no you know i'm i'm keeping it real i'm going to give it to you raw you know there was a uh there was a joke religion called the church of subgenius so it was partly a satire of other religions and it partly was a real religion unto itself and uh they they created this uh meme which is i don't practice what i preach because i'm not the kind of person i preach to [Laughter] there's a whole lot of that going on in social media so look so none of you guys want to give this want to give this video a thumbs up which would help other people discover it during the live stream if you have 40 people in the audience and all 40 hit thumbs up youtube circulates it more and then you get more people doing it but do i really care i mean it is what it is i i again this relates back to the main point of this video how many i'm not deluded how many people do you think want to tune in and hear me saying oh you've got a drug drug habit it's your fault you know oh gee you can't do 200 push-ups you're lazy it's your fault like i'm saying on every single topic you can't get your diet together oh gee you're celibate you can't have positive relationships with women or with the opposite sex or whatever you're into with the same sex oh gee you've got sexual guess whose fault it is guess who i'm gonna like guess what kind of positive encouragement you're gonna get from me right like a so much of what i do under so many different headings is telling people what they don't wanna hear so much of what i do in politics is telling people what they don't want to hear oh gee oh oh gee you you lost the war in afghanistan oh but you know what matters is that you tried your best what the [ __ ] think about how demented our coverage of the afghan war is uh i i you know i showed up thucydides all the time but i was reading uh deodorance the other day he's another historian of this period in ancient greece and rome he does ancient greece he does ancient rome he does more than just that ancient mediterranean europe and you know the level of detail with which he is talking about every year of a 25-year long war the war between athens and sparta year by year season by season month by month and then they had this battle and then this happened and this happened in international diplomacy right and you see the level of involvement people in athens had democratically that they are going week after week to debate this in their connects in their equivalent to the parliament because they have direct democracy they're directly involved in debating who should we appoint as the military general who should be the commander for the navy they're really involved in the war step by step month by month for 25 years what do you think i'm going to say to americans none of you can name a single [ __ ] battle from the afghan war you're a 20-year war 19 years to be fair 19 years of war none of you were involved in any way none of you learned the language look at the great universities of the united states oh yes uh uh today washington dc new york and los angeles are all great centers for excellence in afghan and central asian studies these have become the major foci of learning the languages history and culture of afghanistan and central asia no like you know the reasons for the failure are written all over the face of the american public look at the [ __ ] cross section of the american mind why do you think you guys lost the war in afghanistan like well let's really get into a meditation what a bunch of [ __ ] losers you are that in 20 years with over you know with hundreds of millions of dollars per year budget over a hundred years with a seemingly infinite budget you couldn't conquer an enemy you couldn't really win an enemy that had nothing but handguns and they had no navy they're landlocked they had no air force right you couldn't take that down bottomless budget a huge technological advantage you have a much larger population and at the start of the war you had the support of all of western europe you had this part of basically every almost every civilized country in the world was supporting america's war effort back in 2001 2002 and you squandered that support also it wasn't america yeah my point is what i have to say even about something like the war in afghanistan is unbelievably unpopular nobody wants to hear it conservatives don't want to hear it the left foot doesn't hear it the senator doesn't hear i'm giving you advice you don't want to hear under every [ __ ] heading unlike vaush unlike destiny unlike bernie sanders unlike alexandria cortez or something right like whether like no matter what example we we look to you see it was like now there's a sense in which these things are related i mean i think that what i have to say about video games what i have to say about alcohol what i have to say about drugs what i have to say about sex i think it is related you know in a deep way to why it is that my message about politics is so unpopular because we live in a world where most people wanna they wanna be asleep while they're walking around on two feet they wanna they wanna live in a dream and my message is all the time no wake up face up to reality you know what i'm saying uh uh okay so oh now here's okay now we have to digress to answer this question raphael asks i wonder if this is a hebrew name um probably an abbreviated hearing so raphael asks 200 push-ups in how many sets if i may ask so i think about doing a video about this all the time i may do at some point but so sometimes i'm doing 30 push-ups someone's doing 20 push-ups uh and i'm gonna tell you why under certain circumstances it's it's just ten push-ups so when you're doing 200 i'm doing this with my feet way the hell elevated but so these are my feet and these are my hands so my body's at a slant but between every set i'm changing the elevation of my feet up and down and i also change the grip so as soon as you're doing with your your hands like this as soon as your hands are lower down relative to your your torso and then sometimes i do with hammer grips on a bench so your hands are really close together where you're pushing up and that's very different and the other point is you're doing it to exhaustion so if you're doing sets of 30 uh you know you know the point is if at the beginning you're doing sets of 30 later you're doing a different hand grip and you're more exhausted you're doing 20 and 10 and stuff so yeah all right so that is my that is my digression on uh on doing 200 plus push-ups is that i'm mixing it up and by the way that's why you get so much exercise out of push-ups if you just do push-ups in the same posture whether that's with your feet elevated or your feet on the ground you're not getting that much exercise but when you're changing the angle a lot and you're changing your grip then you you really get a hell of a workout of doing push-ups and you know my gym most gyms don't have a bench press on multiple angles you just bench press at one angle so that's a big uh that's a big you know so look here's another comment noel says shout out to noel for this comment now i do get comments like this that are well intentioned sometimes noel says isil could increase his fan base on youtube by 500 times easily if he just decided to sell out a bit then it gives me a smiley face i don't believe it noel i'm just being real with you i don't believe it it's it's i you know i can take a compliment you know thank you but you know think it's very hard i mean look even the videos i did it's a great example actually i think about it do you guys remember i did some videos about the tv show the mandalorian so this is a sequel to star wars right even what i have to say about the mandalorian is in the same way like profoundly unpopular and it's telling people things they don't want to hear and uh i i remember this about the last video i met the mandalorian the last video i made about the tv show the middleware and i remember this about the last video i made or one of them about uh game of thrones a song by far i think it was the last video another thing though okay i remember getting a kind of fan mail message from the audience saying hey like i saw your video on the mandalorian but i didn't want to watch it because i know your critique is going to point out things that are wrong with the show and then once i see them i can't unsee them and i can't enjoy the show like someone writing and saying i know that you're right but i don't want to hear it like i want to imagine the show is better than it is and i remember the last video i did about game of thrones song about sorry if it's not the last the second last or something but you know um yeah i remember someone writing in it was the video i did which was like look here are really logical problems that's right it was about the books it was both the errors and the things that are wrong in the books the books the tv show was based on and i remember a couple people writing and saying dude like you're right but i don't want to hear it i don't want i don't even want to listen someone right someone who listened to five minutes of the video and stopped and was like dude like i see i see you know your stuff you know what right but i don't so even litter records if you say if you say i could sell out i have viewers in my audience still to this day who discovered my channel because the videos i made about a song of ice and fire game of thrones there's no doubt that did expand my audience but even then you know i kind of can't sell out i'm uh you know i i i i'm not it's not really going to increase size pockets so there you go so uh basugi i assume this is a korean name bei silgi yeah well it's been a long time i did study korean way back in the day but it's been a long time since i've studied korean so i can't attempt to pronounce this anyway uh besogi says and it's been long times of being to korea too i have fond memories of being in korea uh quote yes isil could sell out and get views but his mess his message is the antithesis to what people believe like he said most people want to be in an illusion close quote um and the other thing is the people who are promoting the illusion on the other side it's a crowded market you know it really is like there there's a there are already a lot of people doing that and the vast majority of people who uh who try you know fail so no i'm i'm just i'm just very skeptical about that um but look there are areas so let me just make this clear before i gotta return to val's email message there are areas in which i unironically and positively have a message to share with the world that's not uh harsh or cynical or approachable and i think that writing children's stories book storybooks is an example that i want to write and publish storybooks for children that have a positive message for children and that i think parents will recognize as a positive message a lot of the same stuff i'm saying here well so look here's okay this is deep okay disclaimer okay i'm warning you okay you've got a trigger warning trigger warning this is deep the same people who watch a degenerate youtuber like destiny watch you degenerate youtube were like vouch and who think i want to live this guy's lifestyle i want to be like this guy you know the same people who watch hassan abby and approve of hassan abby going to sleep with prostitutes and what those people if they are raising a child they don't want their child to turn out that way even if they're fine with turning out that way themselves right that's the bizarre paradox which is that if you write a children's story book that's encouraging children to be hard-working and sober right let's just keep it at that encouraging children to be more intellectual more erudite right to care less about the pleasures of the senses to care less about self-indulgence right if you write children's story books with that message all kinds of parents will pick up that story but go oh wow this is great for my kid this is great for my niece or nephew right this is a good message for kids but if you as an adult talk to other adults that way they'll say this is a terrible message for me i don't i for me myself no i want to live a life of total self-indulgence i want to be a degenerate like they don't want to hear that they don't want to apply themselves if you just say to someone like look you know you can lead a better life you can lead a more meaningful life you can stop you know making excuses you know etc you know uh people get defensive and people get offensive people say how dare you say that to me but if it's in a children's story book they respond to possibly because they think it's a good message for their own kids now that's not the only example i totally think i could make a spy movie you know you can call it a james bond movie i don't mean the actual character dreams but make an entertaining spy thriller that reflects my understanding of american politics probably also my understanding of chinese politics and soviet russian politics whatever whatever period it's said you know that reflects the fact that i have all these decades of knowledge about politics frankly i know there's gonna sound word i could write a spy thriller that's set in ancient greece that said in ancient rome you could have a spy movie that's set in the peloponnesian war you know with al qaeda's and his skullduggery and the persian empire and athens and sparta but any case whether you're talking about a 21st century or uh 2000 years ago you know i could make a movie that's entertaining for people and that has this kind of moral and this kind of message and people will respond to that possibly and they do people go and watch corny movies that tell them positive things in this sense that tell them to be a better person and they respond to that positively whereas you know again so a great example can contrast me to tana marcho you know i i understand why people respond so positively to tenemos that's what they want to be they want to be a lazy self-indulgent drug addicted person they want to be a vain shallow person who just lives a life of sex and drugs i'm sorry but when you think about the word degenerate if tana mongeau's current lifestyle is not degenerate what is you know people want that for themselves and a lot of people they work a job five days a week then one day a week they live like tana mongeau and then one day a week they're hungover and recovering from it so they can go back to their job on monday but that's a mass phenomenon not very many people live like tana martial seven days a week but a lot of people they are working for the weekend they live like a total degenerate one day a week maybe two days a week and then they have to clean up and get back to work and 10 years go by and that's their whole [ __ ] life and they haven't they haven't met any there haven't been any progress anyway i could tell a whole bunch of stories now but people i know like that people people who were not drug addicts people who didn't ever go to rehab or something but they were you know they were quote unquote moderate drug users moderate alcohol drinkers but that's it 10 years go by and they've been at a complete standstill just working a nine-to-five job and this kind of uh this kind of degenerate self-indulgence but anyway look sir my point was here you know directly people are never going to respond to me in my life positively the way they respond to tanima show nor the way they respond to tess begg we're showing a test bag a lot in this video she's already burnt out and quit youtube she doesn't upload anymore but she made a lot of money back when she did you know i i understand that and i accept that but i think it's interesting that when you just clothe it in narrative fiction whether that's a children's story book or a spy movie or an action movie i could do a kung fu movie too you know sorry by the way i mean writing directing producing i'm not going to be the kung fu star myself maybe i'd have a role as a uh maybe i'd make a cameo appearance in the background of my kung fu movie you know but you know i know so much about buddhist uh philosophy and so on i could do a kung fu movie in that kind of setting east meets west uh setting what was that the movie that had jackie chan and an african-american actor rush hour rush hour yeah yeah yeah yeah the next next rush hour movie written by eisel mizzard i could totally do an east meets west kung fu movie that has a lot of these philosophical points and then people would accept it but exactly what people don't want to hear is what i had in that i'm just giving you the link again it's like exactly what i the kind of disruptive honesty that you see if you click on that link that's what people don't want to hear they don't want to cope with they want the kind of soft encouraging approach of tana mongeau uh or what have you you know they they don't want to deal with this kind of disruptive honesty okay just glance at your comments before i go back to this guys melissa if you want to jump in there's a chance yeah so common sense skeptic says quote movies are tricky to sell if you figure that out share how you did it written three and they're still shocked okay okay okay common sense i am a fan of your youtube channel i am i am but come on bro come on anyone anyone who looks at your youtube channel anyone who even hears the the interview i had with you nobody would think you are that dude who can sit down in a pitch meeting in hollywood and sell your script and i'm just keeping it real with you uh common sense catholic so i've been into comedy since i was a teenager you know and i may go back to now doing stand-up comedy doing live stand-up cards i cannot imagine you getting on stage and rocking the microphone i can't imagine you doing the pitch meeting i can't imagine you doing stand-up i i just can't see you in that role now look you have all kinds of advantages over me i mean you know i i don't do physics calculations you know there are all kinds of ways in which i never developed my mind and you know i tried there was a time when i was a younger man when i was interested in in physics and so on there are other paths i could have gone in life but bro it does not surprise me in the least that you have failed to make it as as a screenplay right and look the ultimate thing is bro so i'm saying this to common sense skeptic but this goes to everyone in the audience if you want to succeed you have to enjoy failure you have to enjoy failing again and again and again it's a great comparison you can say that with stand-up comedy and you can say that with writing directing and producing movies right oh you want to have a successful movie how about you do 10 failures first that's how it works right so oh gee you wrote three scripts okay why don't you move to la go on a website like model mayhem get some non-union actors get some models to play the parts get out there film it put it together maybe achieve the same uh level of professionalism as the troma pictures or you know a crappy youtube channel like angry video game nerd you know do some really low budget you know filmmaking how about you do that five or ten times and then succeed and you know if you want to do stand-up comedy if you want to audition as an actor i've said this years ago on my channel i'm talking about this five years ago okay i hope you enjoy getting on stage and telling a joke and nobody laughs you gotta have that experience ten times you know you've gotta you've gotta get up on stage and fail and you've gotta learn from the failure or accept it or grow from it you've gotta embrace that you know and you've got to audition for parts again and again again even if you're an ugly middle-aged man there are a lot of movie roles for ugly middle-aged men you've got to go and do that again again so you've got to love the process and you've got to love failure so no look it's great having common sense kept in the audience i'm happy to have them here and i do i believe i've watched pretty much every single video on his channel which adds up to a lot of hours i'm still waiting for the plot twist i'm waiting for the plot twist where he admits that he's wrong and that actually elon musk's solar energy project is wonderful and it's going to be a great success there may be you don't know what's going to happen next in this story you know or maybe the plot twist is that elon musk goes to jail [Laughter] but uh anyway no i i do i do uh enjoy his youtube channel although i watch it skeptically but yeah you know um uh it's uh look i mean the great thing about living in in the time we're living in now is i'm writing a book right now and it's it's whatever it's 95 finished um you know i'm writing this book and there already is a built-in audience for it there are already people who know what to expect and you want to read what i have to say because they know me through youtube that's something that didn't exist 500 years ago or 200 years ago that's really the wonderful thing but it's so so sorry my point is here the relationship between my personality and the reading audience the fact that people have some sense of sympathy for me and some sense of interest in me that's what sells the book right and i don't know maybe 300 people read the book maybe 500 people read the book maybe 1 000 people read the book i used to work in publishing i used to work in non-fiction publishing we had all kinds of great books never sold 100 copies never sold 500 copies like in 10 years they don't sell five of cups so it may sound like a small number but if you really have that connection people but i think in that same way that's social media made everything else more like hollywood the reality is if you are pitching a script you have a one paragraph description of what that script is like hey here's my idea for a movie and for the most part you actually are selling your own personality right you're not really selling the script you're not really selling the book right it's that people are interested in you and people care about you so they're they're interested in in what you they're interested in the spy movie you're going to write like oh okay so look you know so you can imagine when you're pitching the script you are picturing your personality okay so you're a guy who used to be a scholar of buddhism you lived in thailand laos and cambodia and now you've written this action movie and and you have a background in political science and whatever and you're this youtuber okay and now you've written this action movie that has buddhist themes it deals with how the cia really works in the real world the kind of debunking of popular misconceptions with us yeah okay this is what you're bringing together so that's what you're selling you know that's your song in a pitch in the same way that people read my book because they've seen my youtube videos and they have some sympathy for me or some curiosity in me they're willing to hear my hear my uh perspective um in that same way you know most most of uh making movies even on the level of motivating your own actors right you got to go and pitch to someone you're hiring someone on model mayhem for 300 dollars so you're paying next to nothing for someone to come make your movie you it really is your personality that people are buying into okay um questions about where people can buy the book the book is not available yet i assume i am just going to dump it on amazon it will be purchased from amazon.com that is my assumption at this time and i'm talking to someone there's a husband and wife couple who tell me they're going to translate it into spanish so the interests know how quickly they work i think it'd be really amusing to have it published in spanish and english bilingual right off the bat but if not maybe the spanish version will be published separately so you guys know i have a long a long history with translating my videos into other languages and reaching a huge audience that way too let me tell you think about how many people watch my videos that are in russian i do have a couple videos in russian let alone a german etc all right um okay so we're continuing with valve's email here uh most gamers are simply not mature enough to understand the importance of other values in life their mindset works via a simple system of coordinates such as pursuing immediate pleasure and avoiding immediate punishment it comes back to things we talked about an hour ago here and they are just not ready to accept any other concepts or values at their current psychological age so they just say something irrational confirming their bias protecting video games since it is their main value and shut down this leaves me with two choices one to continue to tell people the explicit truth in which my negativity toward video games can hardly be ignored in this case my audience would be mainly mature parents or gamers who are already prepared to quit playing video games by their life circumstances which is a tiny minority or two to stop explicitly being negative to stop explicitly studying warnings against video games and to use a more subtle approach like focusing uh pardon me like focusing on helping gamers to solve their life problems which are of course caused by playing video games and then when solving these problems maybe the viewers in the audience maybe these video game players will take actions that help them to recognize and overcome their addiction he says quote i believe that the second approach can lead to significantly better results in the first one and will help people that would have never even thought about quitting video games before so close quote um but what you're saying here is that dishonesty is better than honesty right you know why did i quit buddhism i didn't want to be part of a religion that was based on a lie and this is relevant to what comes up in this in this email in the next and final paragraph okay what if you said the same thing to me but you said well the really effective way to get people to quit playing video games is to have them convert to islam to believe that there is this god watching over them all the time right now even if in some sense that's true it's a terrible truth and morally i'm not willing to do it and you know what are any of us worth what's the point of any of this if what we're going to do is live a lie or convince other people to live life like either you believe that cutting off part of your penis to satisfy the god that muhammad communicated with uh through the angel gabriel like you know like either you believe that is true or you don't i do think it is good and helpful to lead people into that illusory way of of life or you don't right so so i'm saying this this very concept of what would be more effective may be misleading or maybe counterproductive and let's bring this back even to uh let's bring this back even the tanama show how did tana mongeau become famous in the first place how did she connect with an audience it was through honesty it was to keeping it real i can remember tana mongeau just sitting and talking about working in a clothing store when she was a teenager and i'm sorry i forget if it was hot topic or forever 21 but it was some normal clothing store in a shopping mall and she became the manager of this store you know she got some kind of promotion as opposed to just being a sales girl and her sitting there and talking about folding sweaters and what this job was like and that was really real that was really honest and i mean she she came out as a as a storyteller and that's what people connected to do you think tana mongeau would have been more successful if she came on youtube and was living a lie was presenting something fundamentally dishonest something fundamentally untrue now you can think of something that's that's radically ridiculously untrue like uh like islam like the muslim faith like praying or like circumcision or something that's one kind of falsehood right but there were other kinds of falsehoods too like what you're what you're suggesting yeah you know now sorry you guys are going to see in one second here why i'm raising this a lot of people convert to buddhism on the basis of false promises and misrepresentations about buddhism people lie about what the religion is people lie about the history of their religion you know so and so forth um people lie about meditation people lie about what meditation is and what the benefits of meditation can be right but people who are attracted to that they're not attracted to buddhism they're attracted to the lie and a lot of times they get quite committed they'll pay for a package vacation they'll pay for a meditation retreat they'll get involved with buddhism up to some extent and then they they figure it out oh okay this is what was advertised and that this is the reality of what the religion is i would assume sid is also about mormonism scientology a lot of religions you know ancient and modern um why do you think you would make progress this way by living a lie by portraying a lie by fundamentally being dishonest with the audience i think especially when you're talking about youtube like honesty is the only currency we've got the only thing we can you know the only thing of value here on youtube is honesty earnestness you know the the immediacy of sharing in someone else's life through the glowing screen that is what tana mongeau had going uh in her favor and that's what i had going in my favor and what what do i have to offer my audience really what's the value of this you know um if what i were doing were false or phony anyway which is one of the reasons why i find the kind of conspiracy theories about my life so hilarious and ridiculous you know um if this were insincere it would be nothing worth so you know i say again my old my old catchphrase you know honesty is the is the only currency we've we've got um all right here's a funny comment from the audience uh vassel kolarov said um quote i tried to convince my ex-marxist friend who is now a utilitarian to quit playing video games and go sober it was a waste of time unfortunately okay but what's interesting is you're telling me this is someone who already quit marxism right now okay we're talking about sobriety we're talking about quitting playing video games a couple years ago everyone was reflecting on the significance of the alt-right phenomenon in american politics and one of the most consistent patterns with the alt-right was that guys would convert to this ideology that would immediately start hitting the gym they would become sober they would quit video games they would quit so-called degenerate activities they'd become these highly motivated you know right wingers with a shorter sharper haircut they'd start dressing better they'd start wearing fancy suits and they'd start reading about and talking about ancient rome now like a lot of people observe this they're like oh well my son or my grandson you know he totally turned his life around like i noticed these changes in him but then i was really concerned because it's like he's kind of sort of becoming a neo-nazi he's getting involved with this crazy right-wing ideology and the interesting thing is too when those people lost faith in the alt-right when they lost faith in this right-wing fat ideology a lot of them went back to being schlumpy being out of shape they grow a beard they wear a lumberjack shirt they go back to playing video games they go back to doing drugs you know they go back to sleeping around there's an aspect of sexual morality in this so i just say you know and we're talking about honesty here i would not even be willing to talk about people converting to marxism or like you know becoming converted to a political ideology in order to quit video games or in order to quit alcohol and sorry so guys i haven't talked that much about veganism in this video but i was just saying to melissa yesterday we were having a totally different conversation i said look when you look at vegans you look at people who become vegan look at people who drop out of veganism um you can make the right decision for the wrong reasons but it never lasts like if you choose to become sober because you became some kind of fascist you became some kind of right-wing alt-righter right i'm saying that won't last there are people who become vegan for quote-unquote spiritual reasons they believe something supernatural you know and you can do that for a time but it doesn't last those are the people who go back to eating meat you can become vegan because you want to be sexually attractive you want to be hot you want to look good in a bikini it doesn't last when you do the right thing for the right reasons it lasts your your whole life long you know um and when you do the wrong thing surprise me when you do the right thing for the wrong reasons um i think it's it's tremendously fragile because it only lasts as long as your your commitment to these these these illusions these these self-deceptions you know it relies on you lying to yourself lying to others and living a lie and then sooner or later you know sooner or later that that illusion starts to crumble and then your whole sense of morality the ethos of the life you've been living crumbles along with it and again i've seen this within buddhism i've seen it within communism seen it within you know so-called secular worldviews like communism left-wing worldviews where people really want to live a lie that want to believe uh something that could never be true and then at some point you know at all it all falls apart and then you'll return to whatever it is you'll return to drinking alcohol playing video games sleeping with prostitutes whatever it is you manage to quit in the name of for the sake of this this higher cause this hallowed abstraction that you believe in and yeah i am saying in response to val's email no that's not the way forward the way forward has got to be a kind of radical disruptive honesty instead it's got to be something something authentic in earnest because on youtube that's all we've got um okay so now this is the final sentence or two of his email quote this second approach is successfully used by dr k on his healthy gamer gg youtube channel he never confronts uh video gamers he says that he still plays video games himself but all his content primes gamers to find better values in life than video games he then says he'd be grateful if i'd give my opinion on these choices he's mentioned okay dr k is the worst kind of hindu spiritual merchant and i have already made videos pointing this out if you watch his videos you can pick up on this if you join his discord server it's even more obvious but he is peddling the worst kind of um diluted hindu spirituality to a predominantly white western audience okay i do regard dr k as someone just as evil as a youtuber trying to convert people to scientology that's a good example it's a good parallel um what he is saying about meditation and yoga and the vedas and the yogi's and the upanishads okay it's not harmless it's much more dangerous than a christian preacher quoting the bible and the impacts this is going to have on people's lives are really really negative and really really significant so from my perspective like the best case scenario for what dr k is doing is that he reaches out to these people they may be young people or they may be older people who are at a very low level of intellectual sophistication they may be fully grown adults but who are dumb enough they have teenage enough attitudes that they're they're susceptible that he reaches out to these people and he draws them in with this web of lies to this combination of hindu orthodoxy and hippie spirituality right that in the same way that i just described someone signing up for buddhism not because they really understand what buddhism is but because of an intentional misrepresentation of buddhism they sign up for a fictional version of this religion this ideology and just like these neo-nazis and just like some of these communists for a short time they're highly motivated they're highly motivated to purify themselves so they can live up to the standards set by this abstract ideal they believe in right but sooner or later their belief in that ideal crumbles or they realize what an illusion that is or they just contrast two different versions of the illusion like oh well this is what dr k says about the upanishads and the vedas but now i've actually taken the time i've actually read the upanishads videos i've read some scholarly work and some essays explain oh oh this is the actual history of hinduism this has happened again and again and again a guy named uh rajneesh who later used the name osho osho you know um as a spiritual leader he created this crazy diluted like version of hinduism for westerners that among other things was pro-sexual freedom it encouraged you to to sleep around to some extent uh not recklessly by the way but compared to real hinduism in india it was certainly a very liberal sexual lifestyle that his his followers were entitled to to to commit to okay but at some point even the most devout believers in osho they actually go to india they see the reality of the caste system they see the reality of this tremendously repressive patriarchal religion they see the reality of the status of women in hinduism you know etcetera etcetera this happens again and again throughout so many different religious groups both both ancient both ancient and modern right all that you're doing is asking people to commit to what's fundamentally an unsustainable illusion you're asking them to do the right thing for the wrong reasons and so ultimately it it cannot last in the end what is discredited is your ideology what is discredited is the hallowed abstraction whatever people who believe in and you are discredited yourself sooner or later each and every one of these people has to figure out that dr k doesn't know what he's talking about when he quotes the vedas dr k doesn't know what he's talking about he talks about the yogis and yoga dr k doesn't know what he's talking about when he discusses the upanishads he also likes to talk about buddhist philosophy sometimes he doesn't really know anything about buddhism and you're gonna figure out that dr k doesn't really know what he's talking about when he's talking about quitting video games all right the hardest road to take is that narrow path of inviting people to do the right thing just because it's the right thing to do right but that is the most durable path and now i've i've been on youtube long enough around eight years more than seven years okay i have been on youtube long enough that there were people who came to this channel and they heard about that ancient narrow path that they heard about doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do and they really didn't hear it they're like [ __ ] this unsubscribe close youtube window they go away and five years later they remember it and they come back and they say to me you know what you were really on to something you're right like years have gone by they've believed in different illusions they've embraced different ideals they've tried different things but you know what the really simple uncomfortable fundamental truths you were talking about on your youtube channel yeah you know what and it may be five years later and maybe 10 years later and it may be 15 years later really dealing with doing the right thing because it's the right thing to do it is not going to bring you fame it is not going to bring you money it's not going to bring you tens of thousands of of youtube subscribers right but it's always going to be better than selling people an illusion than selling people a dream above and beyond talking about sobriety versus drug use sobriety versus alcohol you know above and beyond the difference between self-discipline and self-indulgence above and beyond something very specific like you know video game edition we are talking about the extent to which you want to live your life in a dream or the extent to which you really want to live your life awake as an adult dealing with reality there's way more public demand for the peddlers of dreams than the peddlers of reality even when it comes down to something as narrow as talking about sobriety you know talking about doing the right thing because they're into there are more people today who are making money telling you to quit drinking alcohol or quit doing drugs for the sake of your immortal soul so you can go to heaven after you die they're always going to outnumber the people who are talking about the real reasons to be sober and the real you know the real reasons by using alcohol or even by using antidepressants prescription medications and drugs why those are negative things in your life right the illusion the dream it's always gonna be you know more more popular than reality there's gonna be more money more fame more you know there's a bigger audience for that right but no of the two options you've presented me with here val i think there's only one that's that's viable right and why is that you can't really put yourself in the position of telling the audience to do the right thing just because the right thing to do if you aren't doing that yourself and as strange as it may seem i think that is the kind of authenticity someone like tana mongeau had on her channel when she first got started and that's you know that's what i've got going for me here on this youtube channel you know today and you know being honest is not the same thing as being right you know you can be wrong and you can be honest about it you can fail and you can be honest about it you can fail again and again and again um being honest doesn't mean you you know all the answers but um you know being honest means at least that you're going to sit down with your audience and really deal with the implication of these of these questions"},{"id":"fB-zK7YiYBU","text":"so we came to the hospital they ran the test and i mean they were swift man you know we got to get you into surgery your main like main artery or something it's clogged up the left artery that supplies what your left side of the heart has been 100 it was 100 yes this will be a transparent video that everybody been waiting 14 years for 1994 to 2001 i got out i got into becoming a personal trainer and the stripper did well with that but i became a recidivist went back to prison four times that's when my curiosity of stats pads with pets roids whatever you want to call them came into play you know coming from prison i talk down all bodybuilders and people that use roids and all that like everybody else is probably watching you know i was one of those guys that's why i understand you guys oh them what dudes man i got videos you go back to my first videos i'm at diego's gym talking crap lifting a hundred pound dumbbell behind my head tricep extension little bodybuilders on royce can't do this [Music] i seen a video of jay cutler ronnie coleman flex willer they had all these cars and houses man and i'm like it's money like that in bodybuilding shoot maybe i should sign up i know i was too old for football or professional sports so i was like let me try that then doing research on roids and all that found a few people that can hook me up so i started testing the waters i had uh bought all the books i had googled every every day i used to google eight hours a day i was about 36 years old at that point i knew it wasn't a lot of money in bodybuilding so i was like nah it ain't worth it let me just focus on my youtube and social media at that point i was like i don't need to be on all this stuff if you go ahead and start taking testosterone right now your body's natural production is going to shut down because you're receiving it synthetically you receive synthetic testosterone your body's like hey i don't need to [ __ ] produce test anymore that's where the testicular atrophy comes from shrinking of the testicles because they're no longer necessary because you're injecting synthetic tests into your body and they shut down now you have a lot of testosterone in the body and you're getting bigger you're getting faster it's like you're going through puberty again but synthetically you're [ __ ] jacked you're dead your dick's always hard the [ __ ] wind blows you're like hey what's up dude great i loved it there's no feeling out there like taking 1500 migs of tests 600 migs of [ __ ] trend 100 makes an anna draw a day 10 ius of growth a day [ __ ] stiff dick in it it's wild it is what i mean i love it it's a superman drug i'm into them that's where my personality means i feel alive alive what happens when you stop taking testosterone your testicles just don't magically say hey i'm going to turn back on then now we have a [ __ ] problem now you don't produce testosterone your your your your dick doesn't work the same and then on top of that you're going to go into slight depression because now your hormones are a mess i recently quit taking high amounts of steroids i'm on trt i go to the doctors i had really good people in my life like dr prisk when i tore my tricep telling me to cut the [ __ ] [ __ ] the past year and a half has been mentally brutal on me because it's going through changes of identity because for 20 almost 20 years been geared out [ __ ] sauced and stiff dick in the [ __ ] day and i think some people get stuck in that mentality because this is all they have and and that and that's tough now on the other side my mentality for life has changed because i can't do that because it will [ __ ] kill me it will we all have to move on in life at some point because if we just continue to get stuck in our ways of this lifestyle it will [ __ ] kill you it's not a joke i eat 50 vegan i eat one red meat meal a week because i don't want to be in the news for that they ain't coming back you guys ain't coming back so i got on a trt which for me was like one uh cc of testosterone uh every 10 days and so i was able to sustain with that 2016 i decided i wanted to have kids so i went to ivf clinic did all the tests saw that my sperm was zero for me i thought i was always taking a minimal amount of uh pads or whatever stairs whatever you want to call it juice so evidently not it shut my sperm down completely i didn't use no steroids for about a year and a half because once she got pregnant i was like it's time to blast off so my girl got pregnant in 2018 i want to say i was a pessimist with the doctors conspiracy theorists with hospitals and all that stuff so i was like oh they just want my money i'm looking healthy and they jealous they trying to find something wrong with me you know they was always telling the truth i would ignore it and so when we did the ivf i did the physical same thing blood pressure high not abnormally high but high 150 over 90 or 80 something like that and i would say that oh y'all don't have a big enough arm thing to put on me yeah doctors even told me at times my cholesterol was high i had warning i always knew there was an issue you a bodybuilder if you've been on juice three four five years boy and because i'll tell you i took pride in saying i took the less stuff possible anybody on that juice bro you better go get checked out bro bro if you ain't been in this situation all you're doing is speculating i'm first hand in this situation where i thought i was doing everything i was cycling off i get off the three months that's why everybody would be he got small because i get off then i get back big yeah i always thought i was doing it right evidently i was and i know y'all ain't because you want to win a show so you ain't gonna never get off and guess what your system is f tall my advice would be stay fit just get your diet on point high repetition stay fit man there's no money in that stuff and you're risking your life we have a distinction in the english language that runs really deep between the things that you are and things that you have accomplishments you have done as opposed to the person you are the man that you became cali muscle was in prison for 11 years he's told this story again and again and again i don't know if he's adding up all the different jail sentences for a grand total of 11 years if it was a single 11 years tent some of the details i'm not clear on and as he tells the story he exercised rigorously the whole time he was in prison he built up this physical and mental discipline that from his perspective has benefited him for the rest of his life what if he'd had a different kind of notion of the man he wanted to be when he got out of prison what if he'd had 11 years in prison in which he was instead training himself to be a writer he thinks that lifting weights the doing push-ups that exercise made him into the man he is he looks in the mirror and he thinks this is who i really am is it or is it a kind of illusion created by drug addiction that could be the whole video you know this is the most transparent video i did on this topic or issue i'm an old man now so i don't give a damn if you really work hard to write a book if you really work hard to become an author an intellectual a researcher is that book just something you have is it just something you own you possess like an expensive car is it just a status symbol that you put on your shelf this book that happens to have your name on it as an author or is it the case that when you look in the mirror researching that book writing that book and developing yourself intellectually in all the ways that are reflected in the pages that book that that really did change the person you are in a way that's much more meaningful than doing an extra 200 push-ups or lifting an extra 200 pounds bro come on for what women don't even like my swole up like that at least not the super bad ones not the ig models [Laughter] they like you just fit trim with a whole lot of money endure and nice clothes nice call nice part take him to late late night [Laughter] this part of the video is interesting because he's he's trying to put you on game he's trying to let you know if you're a younger man out there making these sacrifices to have these enormous muscles that women don't even want you for your enormous muscles that all that these women care about is that you have money that you have an expensive car that you have jewelry or that you take them to an expensive nightclub he's reaching out to the audience here and saying look you assume that these women are going to want you for your body but actually they're just going to want you for your possessions let's be put they're going to want you for what you can do for them what you can buy for them what you can give them but there's a whole other paradigm here imagine if cali muscle instead had spent 11 years in a prison cell developing himself as an author developing the life of the mind instead of the life of the body he be in a position to say to his audience now look [Laughter] there are women out there in this world and they don't want you for your money and they don't want you for your car they don't care what car you drive they don't care if you're flat broke they'll support you and they don't care about your muscles and they don't care about your body and they don't care if you gain 50 pounds or you lose 50 pounds there are actually women in this world who are going to connect with you and have a meaningful relationship with you that can last for the rest of your life because they read your book because they read your articles because they appreciate you intellectually for who you are and for the life of the mind that you can live together believe it or not i get people writing the email asking for advice on this stuff and i think those people who are asking me for advice on some level they already know and they already fear what i'm going to tell them there's a reason why they're writing to me and not to a thousand health diet exercise gurus on the internet who will be happy to get the same email and tell them what they want to hear these people who write to me they remind me in a really weird way of the students i had in china when i was a university professor for just one year teaching english in a university in china the hardest thing in the world to do was to go up to these students and take away their cellular phone they had no concept of the life of the mind doesn't mean they were dumb some of them were smart some of them were sharp some of them were intelligent in some inherent sense they had no idea even of how to sit and pay attention and listen to a lecture and they had no concept of how to stand up in class and speak themselves and contribute they were at that level of intellectual disability and we all know in the 21st century they're the majority there are people who spend their whole lives with their heads down over a cell phone and the only time they look up is to look in the mirror and say who am i they look in the mirror they look at the reaction they're getting whether it's on instagram via dating app like tinder and they're not thinking about the extent to which if they really developed their minds if they really grew intellectually they would see a different person in the mirror there's something else not that they would have not that they would own nothing they would have accomplished not that they would have merely done there's another person and there's a better person that they can be and that is a person that cali muscle has never even taken five minutes to imagine because he grew up playing sports and he grew up watching action movies where there's a guy with this kind of body in a ripped shirt saving damsel in distress we all grew up with the same stuff and we i grew up watching those movies too we grow up with no idea of what it means to be an intellectual and whether we're locked into a prison cell for 11 years or we're locked into a university campus we go into that isolation you know we go into that opportunity without any clear concept of how to develop ourselves because we live in this culture where were not given any positive example of what it is to lead the life of the mind [Music] maybe we can we can practice"},{"id":"faMsJV8VKn0","text":"if you look at my life from an outside perspective people might think wow daniel's life looks so amazing he just plays video games all day and doesn't have to work but then from my inside perspective i feel empty and hollow like my life is meaningless and i feel very unfulfilled in life in general i think there's a very high probability that after i finish making this video i'm going to play some of the brand new battlefield 2042 because that's pretty fun unlike studying they say life is a never-ending journey of learning but the problem is i've been living this way for such a long time 10 years plus now that the idea of doing anything challenging or difficult or even thinking about learning something new it's just so alien to me i look back at my 20s and i kind of realized how i completely wasted them when i say that i wasted it what i mean is i didn't really do anything during my 20s that benefits me now in my 30s i was wasting my time playing video games and chasing girls and going from meaningless relationship to meaningless relationship when i was in my 20s i never really imagined myself not being in my 20s anymore i could never really think of myself as a 30 year old in the same way when i was a kid i could never imagine myself not being a kid and then eventually becoming an adult and when i was in my 20s i never really worried about things like what are people going to think of me when i'm in my 30s and i've got nothing to show for it apart from memories of just chasing girls and playing video games that's not very impressive and when you meet someone and they ask you stuff like so what have you been doing in japan what have you been doing in the last few years and you don't really have anything impressive to tell them apart from oh i i got 6 000 playtime hours on rainbow six and i got five girlfriends in japan no one is impressed by that and they think you're a loser my looks are gonna fade soon and i'm not gonna look young anymore which was probably the only reason why i was able to get girls in the first place because let's face it it's not like girls likes me for my amazing personality or my huge amounts of money somewhere along the line probably in my early 20s nearing my mid-20s i kind of gave up on all ideas of working towards something i just kind of failed everything i failed at becoming fluent at japanese or korean i failed at trying to get into university i failed at trying to work a normal job and after failing everything it just kind of made me not want to try anymore look man i know what you're expecting me to say you're expecting me to do what all the other success merchants on youtube do and say hey look at this guy his life is a failure not like me like not like a successful person like myself oh and you yes you you can also learn the secrets to success if only you buy my ebook if only you sign up for my course you pay for my coaching or my encouragement that is not my perspective on this matter at all most of you are gonna fail if you're really honest with yourself about what it was you were trying to succeed in chapter by chapter in your life your life has probably been a succession of failures and looking ahead to the future whether your ambitions are great or small it is very likely that the future you have to look forward to is likewise going to be a succession of failures and i i think i think i'm different from most other people just in being really honest with myself and really honest with my audience really honest with my parents my friends anyone who listened to me i'm really honest in looking back at my life and seeing a succession of failures and remembering accurately what it was i was trying to accomplish oh it would be so easy for me to describe to you my experience living and working in thailand as a great success no it wasn't it was a failure it didn't just ended failure it was a failure at every stage all my whole experience you know professional and educational experience in cambodia at a job interview imagine how easy it would be for me to make that sound really impressive and interesting and successful it was a failure and if you think about what my aspirations were what i wanted to do during those years of my life and what i wanted to do in the next few years following after right was a total failure some of the failures in my life are easy to see from the outside and some of them are harder to detect my youtube channel is a failure my whole involvement in vegan activism is a failure and yes yes y'all can any of you remember that i actually enrolled in college to learn how to become a baker that ended in failure but there are two really important distinctions i want to draw your attention to one is this there's a huge huge difference between failing because of something that was lacking in yourself because of something you did wrong some passion some characteristic some capacity or ability that you didn't have there's a difference between that kind of failure and failing because of outside forces that are beyond your control those two things might not feel different from one another when you're actually living through it yourself when you're the one who chose to enroll in a particular college let's just say to learn how to be a vegan baker and then you find out once you've got there once you've already paid your money that that's gonna be impossible not due to any quality you're lacking not due to any confidence or characteristic that's lacking in you not because you don't have the will or the passion or the verve of the tenacity no no no no that's gonna be impossible due to factors outside of your control still you'll regret it still you'll hate yourself for it even if the only thing you have to hate yourself for is that you were so naive so jejune so trusting as to sign up for this program and hand over your money that type of failure failure due to external factors situations that are not under your control there's no way you can see it coming there's no way you can prepare yourself for it but here's what you can do you can choose to have ambitions you can choose to have projects you can choose to have objectives that are so meaningful that even if you fail when you look back at them when you look back on that series of chapters that succession of failures however you want to put it you feel wow yes that was a failure but i learned so much i benefited so much i grew so much by living through that failure now i just said to you a moment ago my youtube channel is a failure what would be success when you're making youtube videos talking about socrates and aristotle and thucydides ancient greece and ancient rome i don't know but i could keep on failing for the next five years i could keep on reading and doing research and making videos about obscure topics in the history of politics and philosophy i could i could just focus narrowly on aristotle for the next couple of years and even if i failed with every single video i uploaded i'd be able to look back on that and say well yeah that video only got 800 views but i learned so much i gained so much if i look back on videos i did just a few years ago i'm able to really feel how much i've learned because i'm able to watch that video think oh if i were to make a video on that topic today it would be so much different because of the reading i've done or just because of the way in which my own perspective has matured it's the easiest thing in the world for a real estate agency to recruit someone by just showing them photographs of their most successful employees they can they can hand it a folder to you say oh look this is dave after just two years working here he earned over a million dollars in bonuses and that and that all may be true but can you ask them yet do you have another folder for all the losers who worked here for years their lives for decades and never made a million bucks do you have a folder for all the people who maybe only worked here for six months or a year and they were just terrible at the job and couldn't hack it and then had to leave and find a new a new career path do you have some way of quantifying the extent and depth of failure and if all you're motivated by is money or if all you're motivated by is sex or the strange fleeting kind of enjoyment that comes from playing video games if this doesn't work out if it fails when you look back at what you've done what is that that you're gonna feel you've really learned in what way will you be able to say that this succession of failures has made you a better person y'all already know what it is no pain no paper head pulling cable with no mess get getting how you kneel i don't live at all but [ __ ] say i can't do it i'm doing that don't tell your mama now i'm coming through that get my [ __ ] money you already know what it is crunchy [ __ ] black kill

when you're talking about issues with men versus women but there are a whole lot of little things that add up to an enormous difference uh when you're talking about the psychological emotional intellectual development of men and women the path that leads toward the life of the mind and the path that leads so many people away from the life of the mind you know the decisions you've got to make that'll lead to leading a meaningful life versus a meaningless one or that can end up with your life frankly being in ruins because the stakes are very high i mean i'd say the light motif that comes up again and again when you're reflecting on the difference between being a woman and being a man in these situations is just i know it's an overused phrase but it is the bigotry of low expectations that it's so rare for people to say to women including their own parents including their own brothers and sisters like including their school teachers including their boss at work it's so rare to say to women man up it's so rare to say this is on you you got to reach a higher standard to really you know have this kind of imposition the expectation of excellence of a woman giving it 110 percent i mentioned this controversy to you a couple days ago mostly came up in passing and some some other conversation we had a controversy here in canada more than 10 years ago now where there was a woman running for parliament so she was a candidate in the federal parliamentary relations these are national elections now this controversy it partly involved people's changing attitudes towards the internet and privacy because a group of journalists had gone around and basically gathered together all of the evidence of people just having posted crap on facebook and twitter and it was mostly facebook but they'd aggregated together the data from these different candidates in different elections and they'd come up with some really embarrassing evidence of just how stupid they were so this woman she's not a kid she's not a teenager she's a fully grown woman she's university educated she's standing in elections at the highest level and she had made a series of mind-bogglingly stupid statements about the holocaust like when you're just looking at the statements or they're her pasting on her own facebook they're not anti-semitic they're not neo-nazi and she's a left-wing person by the way you're just looking at you like what like what are you saying about concentration camps like why it was just boggling and what she said in her defense so naturally this was only after you know the mainstream press caught on to this bizarre news story what she said was that she had never heard of the holocaust before that when she made those comments on facebook she she had no idea anything like this right right and and and people's attitudes you know before during her education during her upbringing during the vetting process of her becoming a candidate like how is it that all these other people around her can be aware of how ignorant a person she is and still put her into an elite leadership role in in politics i think it has everything to do with being a woman and those problems they get worse when you're a good-looking woman now i was saying something similar to you a couple days ago i put up a youtube video about izzy davis right now if you don't know who izzy davis is she's deleted her youtube channel she's deleted uh basically all of her social media to my to my knowledge but she used to be a famous person and she is a conventionally attractive blonde has a history of eating disorders blah blah blah has a history of pool dancing too to be fair so she's someone who got slim and fit enough she's been a gym a fitness instructor and a pole dancer and her university education dealt with chemistry biology nutritional science and at the end of that she's completed her university education at an elite university in the united states of america uh university of berkeley california right this is berkeley um anyway and you know what she's saying is so mind-bogglingly stupid it's showing a kind of fundamental illiteracy in the sciences and lack of familiarity with you know the real basics of chemistry biology nutrition of exactly her field exactly and again like i haven't met her professors i haven't been in the classroom with her but i've been in a lot of classrooms with a lot of people i've been in a lot of classrooms where the professor's attitude towards especially a good-looking white female is totally different from their attitude towards an ugly male a not especially if you're a tall black self-confident male the way the professor treats you like how for how many years did this woman just get kind of waved and nodded through her education yes yes yes that's good good for you dear like kind of pat on the head encouragement and nobody really challenging her nobody really holding her to a higher standard and like let's be honest about how it works education nobody kind of contradicting her stopping her and jumping down the throat saying no no why did you no you you the fact that you said this whether verbally or on your test this shows that you don't really know what you're talking about this shows there's something fundamental you know it can be quite nasty confronting people in a way that draws out their ignorance and draws out what it is they still need to learn or what they've gotten wrong or that really puts them in check and says look the fact that you managed to scrape through the last few exams you may have gotten a c minus but you may have gotten an a plus but you you really don't understand the fundamentals here you're not developing the competence in our culture and in every culture i'm familiar with we have this huge problem of women being held to lower standards and it has a cumulative effect like when you look at people in grade three grade four grade five grade six maybe the boys and girls aren't so different when you're getting up to high school and university age the subtle way in which women are treated different is very different and then we make this transition so don't worry i'm gonna let melissa take over the microphone here at the no [ __ ] let's say but then we make this transition where women the vast majority of women are in a situation where they have the option of letting men solve all their problems in life letting some man fall in love with you and provide you with a home and an income and shelter and everything else of letting some man you know you give up a lot in exchange but letting some man be in charge letting some man pay your bills and of course today it's very easy to visualize because of the internet but whether you become a stripper or uh you know you do cam whoring you do some kind of neutron internet that's a different way of suddenly having men and male sexual attention come into your life and solve all your problems for you now you don't think about career and earning money and education in the same way because men come to your life but i'm just being clear that can be one relationship with one man you can just get yourself one wealthy boyfriend or one wealthy husband he can't even be a poor guy he was a straight job and and works hard if you're a you know you'd be amazed how much money whether in england or the united states of america how much money you make as a plumber just a guy who's been to trade school become an electrician or become a plumber pipefitter like all kinds of like all kinds of jobs for men that don't require university education being uh being a coal miner working in a mine working we just kind of working as a longshoreman working at the docks is over a hundred thousand dollars a year yeah but anyway a man who has no education and no no elite position job he's earning more than a hundred thousand he has more than enough money to take some some woman and it's it's not just good-looking women i've known very homely frankly ugly women who are still in this position where you let some man you know solve all your problems for you and now you're not holding yourself those things you're not asking those questions okay so yeah so that's what we made a video already i mean most of you were you were a part of that we made a video talking about advice for young men yeah right on the other side of the camera yeah yeah no but i feel you were you were suddenly part of that and i thought we were going to talk more about sex in that video than we did it's all right it was already a long video we had a lot to say and this is a video by contrast that's talking about the same issues with with women yeah and i think we agree in like a subtle and pervasive way with women it's all on a higher level of difficulty precisely because other people are making it easier for you okay all right i feel like in that introduction there was a lot covered so we've been talking for about nine minutes and yeah uh really emotionally exhausting nine minutes on camera completely you know completely overwhelming stifling nine minutes there you go okay yeah so yeah of course i want you and foreign uh so yeah there were a lot of different issues discussed there but your perspective on women in education that there are lower standards i have talked to you quite a bit about this off camera like we we've discussed this in various contexts so it's not that i um 100 agree with you or that my experience shows the exact same thing or that i learned the exact same thing through my experience in education so i'm can you give me an example where like you from your experience when you were in class and you felt like there was a real direct difference between how a woman was treated so i i i went to more than one high school and more than one university but you know one of my high schools a very large percentage of the students were black so i would say minimum 30 percent of the students remember maybe in any given year it's 30 40 it would it was not 50 it was not uh half black was within canada that's very unusual most of canada black people are a small minority anyway so this high school any given year 30 40 people were black and yes true to the stereotype i think we had the best basketball team in the city it was i remember finding people in my own family uh who were white in case you didn't know um white people one van would say oh uh are you on the basketball team and did you try it for the basketball team and i was like right you're tall no no in my at my high school it was all black guys on the basketball team and stuff so within canada this is this is very unusual but yeah it was very striking to me i saw many examples of this how the teachers it's my last year of high school high school was five years not four years in canada at that time with a different system so this is the fifth year of high school this is kids who are university age by today's standards right and the way the teacher would speak to a female student was very different from a male student and i've got to say especially when it was a black female student okay so i'll give you an example there was a black uh student and she you know she fancied herself a bit of a radical like if if we were if this had happened in 2021 she would be a young black woman involved with black lives matter that that type of cause so the the black radical dissident causes of the day sure which at that time i mean at the time you know krs-1 was on the radio it wasn't such a popping time for black again you know anyway this is long enough ago that we're not talking about the black panthers we're not talking about blm either but anyway yeah but she was a young black woman who had some uh political pretensions and she gave a it was supposed so i think each of us were assigned to give a presentation on a different university major something you could major in in university and i think we were given them randomly it was something like that like kind of spun a wheel or something everybody got a different thing they had to research and talk about the this major or whatever and the one she was given was classics so if you don't know in english as a university major classics means greek and latin okay and she that's basically what it means to simplify it means studying ancient ancient greek latin and the associated literature and history and politics right and she gave this so this young black woman gave this completely surreal lecture where she was like talking about african culture and and growing up black and stuff and the meaning of the word classics and like classic rap songs oh really yeah but she knew it was supposed to be about college majors uh-huh okay it was like you know and you know that no you meant she was not the only person who in this way like fundamentally misunderstood the assignment which is like no that's like no do it again like you know which is what you basically need to be told and when other people's true demons they were told like no that's not the meaning of this word that's you know what i mean okay and i i remember it's it's an extreme example the whole response of the professor was like oh oh oh good for you oh you you poor dear well you know what you don't realize is that the word classic has more than it was this you know it was the perfect example of the bigotry of low expectations okay you know you're not willing to say to this person no do it again try harder give me more give me a second you know yeah it was just good for you i'm so happy you showed up here's your prize because you ran the race at all really yeah yeah yeah yeah and so this is a female teacher and a female student um i do know that you know part of the problem is just well a lot of young women break down crying yeah you know men do too of course but like where the teacher they may have experience with that they don't want to confront someone they don't want to confront a young one whether it's a male teacher or a female teacher just say no like you failed this is bad you have to step it up you have to be at a higher level you have to do this again you know what i mean um okay okay give you one more because it's really brief and it's really surreal um i think i think i didn't say this on youtube people think of this you there was a very good looking young woman she was really strikingly good looking in in my high school she was white and so this is a similar kind of assignment everyone was given everyone was given a different founder of a religion to do a report on somebody got the buddha somebody got jesus and she got muhammad and she did the whole presentation not knowing the difference between muhammad and muhammad ali i am not joking and and everyone like the other students that was also we had several black people we had several black people in the audience but like oh my gosh like and even i like i wasn't even no like but i remember i said it and like other people in class were like nodding and the teacher was like no they were like okay with me i was like no no muhammad ali and muhammad the prophet are two separate people it's like oh my god like everyone in class is like what like what is this you know and again you know again if if a male student or like a tall self-confident black male student i was a tall self-confident white student if you had had done this you could imagine like the teacher might lay into you did you what are you [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is wrong with are you completely screwed no no and the whole response from the teacher was like well you know it's confusing when two different people in history have the same name um like okay 100 pandering encouraging good for you you tried your best you get an a-min like okay so i know these are extreme but what i'm saying is like in a much more subtle way uh it's i see that going on all the time okay at all levels inclu including often enough in the workplace compared to kind of what kind of work sure yeah so i'm trying to think of good examples from my experience in high school but i can't come up with something as as blatant as that because those are those are pretty striking examples where there were lower expectations for women lower expectations for people who are non-white um right yeah and i agree with you that is a problem like we should we should have the same standards for the assignments that are given to different uh whatever gender and whatever race so right so look you know women's sport is less competitive than men's sport women's prison is less scary than men's prison women in the military are treated different from like it's everything you know like that's that's what's scary and like by the way i think the exceptions prove the rule i think the reason why there's so much whining about how hard it is to be in the fashion industry whether you're a fashion model or a designer is that that's like the one industry where it's only women and gay men like 99 percent of people are either women or gay men and where people are really brutal with each other the same way straight men are brutal with other straight men was like oh no you know like this purse isn't good enough like you know if you want this to be in the show you know what i mean or it's worth where it's on that level yeah all right so before we started recording this uh you gave a notice for about an hour yeah and i was just you know doing oh take it whatever direction you want to take it yeah i know i'm just setting the stage yeah yeah yeah um so i was getting some things some things done in the kitchen and uh beforehand and i just thought of something i would like to say um you see how badly made this cup is this this is the bigotry of low expectations look at how badly come on seriously i don't know who designed that but anyway um i'll bet you money it was a woman so i have a lot of things that i why okay i have a lot of things that i would like to talk about but just because you talked about um breaking down crying uh this this issue uh this is something that you mentioned in your video about men advice for young men too um and you know i think it's just worth telling because i myself was a young woman once uh i myself was 18 years old i myself was 19 years old and i will never get another chance to be 18 years old or 19. we're kind of celebrating melissa becoming middle aged i know you guys think she's a teenager but she's not and we're going i don't think anybody thinks i'm a teenager um anyway uh yeah so um i think it's worth telling this story even though it might be slightly embarrassing for me to recount and i hadn't thought about this at all beforehand so i was just i was just contrasting it so like i have some things written down but just you you bring out the breaking down crying so i had a job when i was in university it was um i think i was 20 years old when i had this job and my boss was a she uh was overweight uh and she was a black woman she had a lot of uh charisma you know she was she was just an interesting person to to spend time or spend time around like you know she was she was um uh she was a character and she didn't really live by the same standard uh these low expectations for women yeah i noticed that um so one example that happened is i didn't i didn't i wasn't aware of my doing this but she noticed that i wasn't coming into work like i would come into work at the last second like i would walk in right when it was about to be 8 am yeah and her view on it was that i should be coming into into the office like 10 minutes early i should be like getting prepared and be ready for the day at like 9 00 am or sorry 8 am right and she one day i came into work and she took me aside and she just you know in a column way said you know come to my office i want to talk to you so this was a workplace situation where i was being called out for something that i had done wrong and uh i i could just feel like my heart rate going up and and i just i've always had this issue with authority with authority figures and somebody like trying to correct my behavior and stuff uh and i do think this is something that is particularly difficult for women to deal with maybe because they don't have as much experience with it because of this sure this different standards these different uh low expectations uh so yeah she just you know she didn't say it in a rude way or anything but she was she was explaining to me like you know you need to come into work earlier i've noticed this have you noticed that every day this week you've come in like right before 8 am rather than coming in like 10 minutes before and uh yeah i i started crying like it was just something that i couldn't help like i really didn't want to and it was just the two of you alone in her office yeah it was just me and her alum in her office and yeah so i i uh i regret that that's how i handle it at that stage you know 20 years old you're not you're not a kid um but still that was that was my level of maturity at that at that stage my ability to handle inter interpersonal conflicts workplace conflicts so yeah i would say that's a that's a big that was a big issue for me i'm not saying all women but i do think it's uh something that is something that we need to learn from i remember an anecdote like that from a guy it's not worth telling the whole story you guys know i've read a bit about the history of the cia he was a guy who worked more with the fbi than the cia but he did both and he complained that when they let women into the fbi and again i think women in some sense have always been involved in the cia but they started having women in higher positions yeah that he said there was this huge change where people would break down crying in meetings people would scream in meetings where he said like he was an old enough guy he remembered when it was yeah you remember when it was all men and when it was all white men because you know there was a time when there were no black people like it was openly racist yeah you know society and um you know look it's just interesting i think obviously i'm not saying i think we should have an all-male workplace i don't believe that but i remember him saying you can imagine in that kind of job whether it's the fbi or the ca there were probably a lot of meetings where there's you know there's somebody got shot in the head because of you or something you know like something really bad you made the wrong decision and now fred is dead you know i mean whatever you know people really break down we women so that's the end of this but the point was women were breaking down weeping in a way that guys weren't before okay and how the whole office yeah yeah yeah so i mean it depends what kind of work you're in right yeah but i just think too like looking back at that situation at that story where it's it's not even when i didn't have the threat of being fired or something it was just the the confrontation that i was not able to like to deal with um like that if it had been a young man a young white man or a young man with a different race you know like how would the expectations be different for them right and yeah that that is something that um i i just didn't think about at that time i was i was so like when you're young like you're so in your own your mind you're you're in your own you're selfish you know um you're not thinking of how you're going to be perceived by other people yeah i just mentioned i have told melissa this story before but i think it's never been told on on camera so my ex-girlfriend from a million years ago my my blonde ex-girlfriend she was going to university her major i think ended up just being english literature maybe i think she did combined women's studies english literature yeah but anyway that that kind of thing and you know she told me this anecdote because i was complaining about the way evaluation and grading is structured in universities where there's just no like if i pour out my heart and soul to research and write this paper and then it just disappears into the system and you get you get a number by email you find out what grade you got there's no meaningful learning from you know whatever yeah and um she gave me an example where she was in one of these big lecture theater classes there were like 400 students in the class with university of toronto we had huge classes there's one professor and hundreds of students in a big lecture theater and she just decided so in case you hadn't guessed she is a good-looking blonde and she's a cute blonde rather than like a threatening blonde you know but she's she was a that age she was a very attractive young woman and nobody said [ __ ] to her and nobody said tire stanza really you know and she decided to completely disregard the stated requirements for like the final essay for this course the essay that's worth like 50 year grade which is also normal at university of toronto and instead of you know everyone's typing on a computer and printing out an essay for so many pages instead she bought one big piece of like art paper so i know some kind of fancy you know colored paper and she got out her calligraphy pens and she used like colored pens and did like decoration stuff in the border and she wrote this like thought poem or some [ __ ] yeah like you know she did this like artistic response to like the book that they were assigned to read yeah yeah yeah with like pretty pictures and like four different colors of pens using chili so she's telling me this anecdote and again like she's telling under the heading of my saying how the evaluation system is is [ __ ] up with universities and she's like and she just heard nothing back she was like when she handed it to like the ta to hand there's like you know they made a funny expression and then she got whatever she got in a minus just like she gets a grade backwards completely disregarding these times and what i said to him without without missing a beat i didn't think about it i didn't like come back to her a week later at the moment seeing their listener tell this story where she describes this [ __ ] arts and crafts thing she did for like a 400 level english lit class at a universe university level and i said to her how do you think your professor would have spoken to you if you were a six foot tall black male she was devastated by this she had never thought about it and it's way beyond white privilege and it's way beyond female privilege or pretty girl privilege it's like your instructor in this course so totally [ __ ] trivializes you as a human being they hold you to such low standards that no one is taking you aside and saying look if you can't perform at this level like if you can't write an essay that meets these standards these specifications but then like dude you can't do this job like you know i mean the same what if you're talking about training someone to be a nurse trains them to be a doctor talking about izzy davis getting a degree in nutrition and chemistry and biology like someone isn't taking you aside and saying look like i don't care how many pretty colored pens you used or how creative you were something like i'm not here to gas you up kid you [ __ ] up like you're falling way short of the minimum standards you're not showing confidence yeah just look i'm sorry but if you were a tall scary looking black dude and again people i mean then and now people responded to me primarily as a tall scary looking dude people were scared of me in toronto not that i'm that scary it's that they're that shelter seriously people were afraid of uh growing up in toronto which is [ __ ] up but anyway um people found me really imposing and intimidating but you know if i if i'd done some [ __ ] like that the professor is going to say look like this is what like this is the kind of confidence i'm supposed to be training you to have yeah and if you're not developing that or if you're not moving up that's like do you want me to fail you like do you want to do the assignment again like what do you want me to do you've put me in a position as a professor like this what you know so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay you know uh yeah i mean these are these are these are the questions yeah anyway look i do have other i do have other examples but you know part of part of the significance of the standard i'm saying is my own girlfriend's response to it when i challenged her that way that was not the only challenge she had a lot of expectations about about society and politics and [ __ ] like she expected to walk into a room and be treated like a princess everywhere she went and especially at that age and looking the way she did i'm sorry she was a very attractive woman that's why i put up with her i'm sure she's a terrible girlfriend terrible relationship i regret it this is really the wrong i really i really regret it but anyway you know she but she was a very good looking uh young woman and it's like look what if you walk like whether we're talking about like city hall or talking to a stranger on the street or talking into a business like what if you were a tall black male yeah and you should hold yourself to that standard like you should be conducting yourself in a way where you would be respected if you were a tall black male like i'm earning my professor's respect or i'm i'm i'm pushing respect at city hall i'm whatever it is i'm doing you know i'm not leaning on this privilege and she had been she'd been totally unaware of it she'd been really sleepwalking through your life that way uh not thinking about the sense of which that shape right okay so yeah i'm not not trying to not picture not trying to be nitpicky i didn't know your ex-girlfriend of course yeah you know i'm going based off of your stories about her so but um she does not have her own youtube channel but yeah i i you know i i hazard i i just i want to i'm not trying to like protect her or something but like when you say that she was uh she was expecting everybody to treat her like a princess or something right like i don't even think a lot of people have that level of awareness agreed agreed it's not that they have the expectation it's just that's what they've experienced in their life and they haven't had someone saying no you should have the same expectations yeah you should have the same behavior or no one even saying step it up try harder right so um yes i do think that this is an issue and uh i don't know if this is something that is more of a problem for women or if it's more of a problem like it okay what i want to say is uh this wanting to uh this ideal of perfection right i don't know if if this is always the case with men and women but i really do feel like men are more okay with their being like errors and what they're being like straight up like like just making mistakes and learning from them i feel like men are like i don't know if it's their experience right from like having the process of older it's not biology no i know but like having older men like critique them older than saying like no you need to do better or something like saying you say women don't have that and therefore like they don't get used to that process of making mistakes and learning from those mistakes and like and and building up themselves that way 40 people in the audience guys take a second to hit thumbs up more people will join the live stream while it's going give you a thumbs up and then afterwards when this is a video more people will see the video so if you think this is a worthwhile discussion take a second hit thumbs up if you change your mind later you can undo the thumbs up and hit thumbs down but you know um yeah that'd be great um because yeah it's it's more interesting when you get more people in the audience and so on so yeah um yeah i was just going to say you you know this is something that i've had to get used to um and and actually be okay with making mistakes and accepting when when i'm i don't know certain things or um accepting that like actually reflecting on what i've been doing like there have been times in our relationship when you've been like you know yeah like you haven't been doing this or that like what's going on like you know step it up like you are not realizing that this is that this is happening you're not you're not holding yourself to any kind of standard at all yeah high or low you're not real think about right yeah yeah and um yeah well look i've broken down crying hundreds of times in this relationship because of that sure that exact situation i'm just like why are you calling me out on this like why can't you just give me a break or something but i know like that but it's not just you broke down crying in response to problems with baking school oh yeah you were basically breaking you know you've yeah you've you've had these stereotypical feminine trait of breaking down crying absolutely you know um yes in response to the difference but look i i don't believe this is a biological difference in men and women i think it's a issue of culture or an experience expectation stuff and one of the most telling demonstrations of this is to look at how effeminate gay men are treated so you can be in all kinds of situations including like when i was involved in the theater i've i've never been involved in the fashion industry but i think within university class classrooms if there is a guy but he really actively cultivates that persona he's a gay man and he talks in an effeminate way because some gay men are butch you know some don't have that person but effeminate gay men there's a similar thing that goes on where nobody's holding the standard nobody's taking them seriously and that can include even when they're doing things that are really wrong or abusive or something they're crossing a line it's like oh nobody takes it seriously why because he's an effeminate man and you're not you know you're not holding the account the way you would a straight man and maybe just fundamentally you don't perceive him as a threat the way he was dreaming you don't perceive what he's doing as consequential the same way so i'm just saying a lot of the same trivialization and i feel denigration and holding people low standards that happens with effeminate with you know out effeminate gay men also yeah i think you can see that in the workplace and you can see that in university and they and again breaking down weeping and everything else so i think that gives you an interesting mirror interesting point of comparison to sometimes ask how would this be different uh for an effeminate gay man and often it's shockingly the same with the kind of low expectations okay i'm going to try to switch topics here although i i says that sounds horrific i'm black and was always told to work harder than my peers because people in england wouldn't take me seriously or something uh my teachers were lovely though um so look i think you know for women generally those days are gone uh really margaret thatcher's generation was the generation where women were told if you want to be taken seriously you have to be harder than a man you have to be harder working but i do also just mean harder if to be tougher than a fan you know you have to really earn it you have to earn it more than any man there was a certain generation that went through that and you know i think we have to be honest too about the fact that the vast majority of women they can't really be encouraged to work hard whether academically or intellectual otherwise with the expectation that there is any good employment or reward coming for that effort like most of these things if you do it you have to be motivated just by wanting to cultivate your own mind or cultivate your own characters the vast majority of both men and women are not going to do a job any better than being a waitress you know waiter or waitress or what have you the vast majority of us go on to jobs to use jordan peterson's idiom to we go on to do jobs not careers you know um but you know do you want to be a waitress who's just a waitress or do you want to be a waitress who's you know really taken seriously as an intellectual in some field you know who's really you know i've you know really really developed herself you know this or that way now there are a lot of guys who take this seriously i mean i know it's like the buddha jokes whether it's in an army unit or working on an oil rig there's some you know there's some guy who's got his you know his books with him and stuff there's some guy who's saying he wants to be a screenwriter in hollywood or he has some dream or he's reading philosophy he's reading friedrich nietzsche or schopenhauer or something you know like you meet guys who have intellectual potent pretensions and aspirations and ambitions above and beyond the jobs they've got but ever so this is just a response to um this comment women who take the the attitude that they have to work harder because they're women or specifically they're black women like you won't be taken seriously unless you work 10 times harder i've got it so i feel that's really the margaret thatcher generation and that was a time when most women who went to education they only have like two paths open them it's like oh do you want to become a schoolteacher you want to become a nurse yeah and there were no other no other career paths open them for my generation women were told all career paths are open to you everything's open to you yes and everything is easy and you're equal without having to earn it you know what i mean you're you're equal i'm saying yes we are we are a slightly different generation but from my experience we have a 14-year age gap yeah so when i was in school definitely it was any career path would be open to women it doesn't matter and there was a lot of encouragement for women to be independent and you know within my own family like that i should focus on my career that i should figure out a way for my myself to be financially independent you know um so you know i i don't i don't know from from my experience you know i admit like i i might have some bias in this way given my just i don't know my background my race my gender and stuff you know that like i didn't feel that because i was a woman that i wouldn't be taken seriously right i felt like it was the same like if i was to become an engineer that that would i would be on this right but you see there's there's there's a there's a way to take positive motivation out of that which is like okay i've gotta try harder i better work and yeah you know i mean i i do think my generation was already after that was over and when just i don't think anyone was trying i grew up with uh it's the kurt cobain generation it's the nirvana general oh generally the whole culture was into nobody working hard nobody having any aspirations nobody giving 110 you know what i mean so yeah but including women so so that that influenced men too but yeah yeah yeah the era of try harder and prove your worth that was that was out of style okay i have a great thing that just came to mind so i was thinking of changing the topic but speaking of margaret thatcher this is just in relation to this topic of female politicians of being taken seriously just the other day we were watching the news do you remember this there was a news story from a well-known politician who was running for president at one point do you remember her she has been involved with conflicts because of her nationality her race her race so uh elizabeth warren oh yeah she i thought you're going to talk about camel harris no elizabeth warren was being interviewed and she was being interviewed about her newest children's story that she had put up oh oh the bigotry of low expectations you're right i think it's a real that oh the the expectations applied to elizabeth warren that is a great example that as opposed to how tough they would be interviewing a man or interviewing a black man or something who had a similar record whoa you're right just the type of the kind of conversation that she was having about her book uh it was all good for you yes yes yes yes just that would not be the kind of i i want to find specific examples but just talking about like uh how much she loved meeting people's dogs when she was on the campaign trail and like this kind of yes really yeah yeah like what is this conversation about um yeah there's a sort of there's a sort of mutual trivialization going on like for the interviewer like i'm trivializing you you're trivializing me we're trivializing this political context yes and like there's no sense of like dude you just lived through 20 years of failure in afghanistan it's on you what the [ __ ] dude you just lived through 20 years of us not solving the problem with global warming and so you're like no let alone dude you lied about your ethnicity and portrayed yourself as an indigenous american for decades and like yeah yeah which is really really messed up no no no sense of confrontation or keeping a nun yeah yeah yeah this is you know anyway you made up complete [ __ ] against bernie sanders you know that was really where she derailed her campaign you know you went up yeah no so yeah yeah i do think it really is the case now that women can get in politics and they can be taken seriously if they behave in a serious way and they actually try to make changes in the world and i'm glad that i'm living like of all the times to be born in the history of human civilization like now is the best time in terms of women actually being able to have representation in government and run for office you know it's a wonderful thing and i i i do despise that i do despise that like female politicians like okay it is true that uh the president can be filmed reading a children's story to uh an audience of school children or something but like the conversation is never about it's never this this ah anyway uh yeah yeah so yeah this is kind of leading to a topic that i want to say let's be clear so in english we say talking down to someone but it's not really talking down to women it's assuming that you don't have to challenge them but you don't have to raise a standard that there's nothing for them to live up to you know it's different the low expectations thing is different from talking down to someone yeah that's that's all i'd say yeah but that's profound and it goes on for women it starts in childhood yeah you know i mean oh good for you and they are just not being talked to now look you know um just just keeping it real you know so look i've known different girls who've been through this from different different perspectives but you know i've known girls who were okay let's start with the male example and also the females there are boys who say they want to be a basketball player and people say to them straight up you are never going to be a basketball player you're five foot two you know and whatever if they say they want to play football right away they're told well you're not big enough to be a linebacker but you can be a tight end or something like they're told what position they can play they want to play baseball it's like well look you don't have what it takes to play this position but you can be shortstop like you know just their physical characteristics you know whether or not they're big enough tall enough strong enough and and then getting into their reflexes what they can and can't do and what i see across the board with women are there exceptions hey there are four billion exceptions in this world you know sure there are exceptions you know what i see with women is women being told again and again you can do anything you want to do you're wonderful even to the point of absurdity of telling women they can do sports they can't do that telling women that they can be a supermodel when they they're just not tall enough they can't be a runway model they're not the right size and shape you know what i mean really like you see that with the the beauty discourse yes that is one other topic that i thought of talking about just this this reality that uh men get comfortable with at a young or maybe they're maybe they still have issues with it but like men have to get comfortable at a young age with being shorter than other men yes with having a build that will never look like other men like right but look sorry but i just want because i was setting up just a transition to the intellectual side of it yeah i remember reading a [ __ ] master's degree thesis if it wasn't a master's view thesis it was a phd thesis written by a woman a female student at university of toronto and i was just saying to my colleagues like if you or i had written this like don't you think we would have been laughed out of the room and like quite possibly we wouldn't have been given directions to rewrite it to start again because normally you don't just fail with graduate state within their patients don't you think we'd be giving this back say look you've got to go back to the drawing board you've got every word where like you you know but my point is i think this does carry on that's that's what i've seen including at cambridge and oxford including at elite universities university of toronto is supposed to be elite where people are just this good for you you tried your best attitude and not saying like no like either you understood what this said in sanskrit or you didn't either you did the work or you didn't either this is at a standard of excellence where it's real scholarship or it's not you know and again that obviously that that applies to women in politics uh like your example elizabeth warren and so on and so forth you know is anyone holding elizabeth warren to the same standards they would hold bernie sanders too frankly you know yeah anyone else on the on the talk yeah yeah sorry take away everyone but yeah i'm just i'm just saying the physical thing matters the physical thing but i am just talking about it as prefiguring and being easier to see example of what goes on intellectually yes so okay maybe the physical thing is the topic that we can get to later on but it is something that i was thinking now yeah okay well just that what i was saying earlier is that i do feel like at a younger age maybe it's because of this team sports thing that that men get comfortable with the fact that oh well maybe i will never succeed in basketball because i'm i'm just not tall enough you know to actually compete on the basketball court you have to be a certain height whereas women are i think deeply uncomfortable with their bodies and we hear this all the time in the mainstream media uh because of these differences and build and the differences and uh where you know just things like where things deposit in your body like just just the shape of your body and things like yes i i do think that uh this this is a difference between uh men and women and and what they have to uh accept about themselves um okay yes so there's something here that overlaps with you're saying okay so junebug says yeah men will say anything to sleep with a woman uh look so you know yeah women do live with flattery they do live with seduction but i think you're missing the point junebug because there's a question about um what men will say just to avoid dealing with [ __ ] from women what women will say just to avoid dealing with [ __ ] women in the workplace in the school do you see what i'm saying like so coming back to even the examples we already used before so i have this school teacher and there's this very beautiful very stupid girl who's just done this presentation where she is unaware that muhammad ali the boxer in the 20th century is not the same person as muhammad the prophet a thousand years ago like what do you want to do do you want this girl like i think on someone this is a woman it's a female teacher it's a female teacher that class like a part of what she's doing is just i don't want this girl to break down crying i just don't want to deal with it like i just don't want to deal with it you know what i mean so again like the team sport situation yeah you know like dudes may be [ __ ] up by it too like being told look uh you know you're never gonna be a heavyweight look at the size of your fist if you're gonna do boxing you're gonna be a featherweight like you're just never gonna be big enough sorry people use fist measurements for that as a as a yardstick you know what i mean whatever it is you tell the guy look you can never your hand your hand isn't big enough to ever be in the nba i don't remember that you don't have what it takes to do this sport or whatever you know and we do we do say to men you don't have what it takes intellectually to do this which could be terrible it could be a horrible thing to say to somebody yeah but there's a lot of kind of man-up stuff that goes on with that like look and there's a lot and there's a lot of saying the boy too hey prove me wrong oh you think you can do it okay go [ __ ] don't you show me why don't you show me you can take a baseball and throw it 99 miles an hour or why don't you show me you can take this book and teach yourself sanskrit like okay oh you want to prove me wrong because i'm saying you can't do it like there's more of that combative challenging thing my point is i don't think this is flattering women because people want to seduce them or sleep with them it's different from flattery it's just people who are like i'm going to conserve my energy i don't want to deal with this i don't want this girl to break down crying and that that kind of thing yeah i think that's a lot okay i think that's a lot of what's going on on the surface going in okay sure um sorry i did think of saying something just in relation to what you were talking about there you go i do feel like men at least have more of this influence of locker room like that that a coach that a coach will push them to do push-ups you know like that women um don't really have that same uh it is statistically it is statistically the case that women after a certain age will stop team sports in high school so like whereas uh it generally the boys will continue doing sports in high school uh the number of women the number of girls who continue doing sports in high school it decreases um and so i think uh girls don't have as much exposure to this this kind of locker room discussion of like you know prepping before a game or something you know um right i'm not saying that that's like the most um that's the best for building up your confidence or that's the best for building up your ability to uh push yourself and like try it fail and try again and stuff but like there there at least is that kind of element to the experience of being a boy in america and just just taking responsibility for your own [ __ ] i mean outside of sports whether that's taking responsibility for planning a trip or taking responsibility for violence in the streets yeah or what have you so i'm sorry probably five years ago or something i told the san antonio but once i was in thailand with my girlfriend as a white canadian girlfriend this is not an asian woman or something and there was this particular alleyway in bangkok thailand at that time i just mentioned how dangerous bangkok is changes from third time to next but this particular alley in the middle of it there was a restaurant and they literally had all times like two guys with machine guns in the front entrance it's like the back end runs to this restaurant the alleyway enters the desert at all times you know as this is a dark dangerous looking alleyway and i just know that i remember i said to my girlfriend in this context she was like oh no we can go up this alleyway and get a thing it's it's pitch black it's night and i remember saying to her do you think that these guys have machine guns for no reason like the guys at that restaurant back there like do you think this is not a dangerous alleyway in bangkok like and i said it to her if we get mugged if we get jumped now who's going to have to deal with it i'm going to have to deal with it i'm going to be the one fighting not you you know this particular vote it's not true of all girlfriends maybe some of you guys are watching this and you have a girlfriend who's actually going to throw down who's actually going to throw fists in in that alleyway situation so look i'm going to have to deal with it all right and then the reality is i'm going to have to console you and make you feel better afterwards right like even though i'm gonna be physically beaten to [ __ ] and we will have both lost our wallets or whatever i'm gonna have to make you feel better even though it's gonna be your fault like why are you making me good really [ __ ] up and all this [ __ ] it's just like she's never the [ __ ] oh no i'd be fine like you know and by the way i've been through a situation the third where i had to stand up for her physically where i had to you know none of them actually got to to fist before i where i had to go after somebody at night uh in an alley where you know there was there was a physical threat of violence or whatever and as a man it's something normal it's something you have to prepare for and i was thinking of this because you know i'm not involved with team sports i never have been involved with team sports i've said this all the time why do i do 200 push-ups a day on my knuckles it's so i can get thrown down a staircase you know i mean it's so i can deal with the the constant threat of physical violence that you deal with as a man including even walking on the streets here you know you do vancouver is worse i mean i felt it more in vancouver whatever you know different situations are worse but there are just so many drug addicts on the street here and [ __ ] and that's it i'm not training for any sport but you know i'm pointing out again that particular girlfriend maybe she was a particularly bad example but i think she's a pretty normal example it's like well she's living her life like there were no consequences for this [ __ ] and men are living their lives in a way like look bro it's on you like all of this is on you and and by the way i think that there's going to be because i really try to involve my girlfriends and wives sorry when i'm married in making the decisions and making the preparations but that can involve also like hey who's buying the airplane tickets like any if you make the wrong choice you know so many women that go through their whole [ __ ] life and they think their only role is to whine like oh i don't like the hotel or whatever like you no seriously sir oh seriously and it's like no no i'm laughing i know because i know women from my past you know i just i i can remember a time early in this relationship but oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and it's like and you've got to say the word wait but you got to say to the woman look if you you could have booked the hotel you could have done the you could have chosen those you know like you could you could be taking a command i was laughing because i that was the influence that i had from my own mother and my own yeah every every woman that i knew yes that was right it's just assumed the man does the planning role in the command rule in the lead role and then the woman's rule is to whine and complain about it yeah it's like no no dude like you well and it sucks too like no like you can be in charge you can be in charge and i want you to be in charge like 50 of the time i'd love that love i did it 60 of the time you solve all my problems you booked the hotel you booked the airplane tickets you got it organized you make it now and you know you take responsibility for the consequences when things go right yeah i know it's way better when you do have involvement with that when it is partly i mean yes the responsibility is there but like when you are actually involved with planning for a trip then like you know from the other side like oh right this is how i was acting when like i was being entertained or like i was being taken somewhere uh i totally took it for granted and stuff so yeah i i do think that's that's that's a legit problem to talk about so one thing that i wanted to say well i would say i think just to close it up i think you can see given all those reflections i think really you know team sports and athletics they fit into their their little subcategory within a much broader problem yeah with the corrosive influence of gender roles that you just said it's no i don't think team sports are like the primary paradigm that creates these other phenomena i think we've talked about a much broader phenomenon here and then team team sports are just one yeah um right so okay one thing that i wanted to discuss branching off of the elizabeth warren interview uh that i do think that this is a time when women can become just as politically active as men and should be i mean that's it's our responsibility and it's half of the population that can that can make a huge difference um and uh so one thing that i wanted to talk about in this is i remember in family conversations like at family gatherings typically when i was younger it was the old men that were talking about politics that were talking about world events that were talking about uh downtown detroit like the issues and the collapse of the car industry the the automobile industry in detroit uh and i remember when i was younger and women would take you aside and say let's have girl talk oh my gosh how did you know have i talked to you about this i don't know i remember that happened once in front of me we were with a muslim family we were talking to you you remember that muslim all the guys are talking about politics she was just looking at your face you're really into it yeah she likes she likes that's why she likes being with me she likes talking about politics and history and this kind of stuff really real stuff and this woman she's a muslim woman wearing the head scarf he explodes like oh let's have girls oh i hate it when they talk about i hate it when the boys are talking about serious boy things let's do whoa okay you remember that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think we talked about that time you were like i hate that that's what happened within my own family was people you know yeah so i wanted to understand what they were talking about because to me it was like getting at all these really important issues wouldn't it sound different like hey you know you and i are [ __ ] let's have [ __ ] talk let's just you know let me just take let's have some let's just [ __ ] time okay let's just lower our intellectual standards all right that is really how i feel about it i i agree with you they're all good at all the way real there are things that women have to deal with that men don't and i do appreciate i would appreciate having a woman to talk about like certain things like menstrual cycles and you know all this that i didn't have that influence when i was a kid like no no woman talk to me about understanding my menstrual cycle understanding fertility and like you know pregnancy and all this stuff like i just didn't get that input so yes that's the kind of like woman talk or girl talk that i would actually like be interested in talking about other women with um but the the general pattern of that was okay so the men are talking about uh race you know they're talking about uh black people in detroit and this this issue between uh white people and black people like what how what is what are the origins of this like historically what's the present situation and what are we gonna do about in the future like how can we how can we solve this issue like yes that mattered to me a great deal when i was growing up i i wanted to know why and i wanted to understand like when we turned on the tv news why is it that the racism of your time about so much yeah yeah i know that was that was a huge part of growing up in detroit obama time too right now yes yes right oh yeah oh yeah i got to hear my racist grandfather talking about the you know the the black house yeah that was what he said because no longer the white house yeah so um legit you know um that really mattered to me and i i was quite angry about it i was quite um passionate about this because you know my education in school was was anti-racist and was uh you know in favor of equality for everybody and i got to see like just the older generation but your point is here women were not dealing with it women were not even present in the discussion women were trivialized they were okay so if they were the contribution was just like so paltry compared to the contribution that men were making to the conversation yeah and um you know this this really mattered to me and i felt like i just wasn't getting the right inputs with like seeing women who who were able to talk about these issues and who had even read a book about this issue yeah the men in my family didn't read books at all like they didn't talk about uh they didn't they didn't read about these things they didn't study them they just were talking out of their ass basically but at least they were talking about they listened to talk radio i think i think that's the i think while driving their trucks they were listening to that absolutely true yeah so yes uh that was my experience when i was growing up and i i uh you know really wanted to understand and but uh at a certain stage i just thought like well um you know it's not not about not taking seriously it's just that i don't know what to say and i can't speak for myself and yeah this kind of helplessness and if i do speak you know i sound ignorant i sound stupid yeah and i'm not i'm not which which is gonna happen yeah like let's just be clear like in case you guys think i was born wise i wasn't you know like you're wrong and you're wrong and you're wrong and then you look back and learn from your mistakes and then you start being right like i'm just saying for me as a teenager or in my 20s i was wrong about a lot of things i said a lot of things that today i would you know regret or today i would disagree with or something that is also part of growing up is that you know so it's not uh you know the the path mentioned men do you know snub each other and denigrate each other and prove each other wrong you know again you don't learn by making mistakes you learned by having your mistakes pointed out to you oh yeah i heard men yelling at each other frequently about like you know when they were talking about these issues and afterwards they would always you know it's not like they were angry at each other afterwards like and i remember a couple of times my father would would talk to me afterwards and just say like you know uh it's all in good fun or something like that yes we're all just talking but like uh no i i i didn't get that from women's discussions women's discussions like focused around like okay so what's little johnny doing like let's talk about his so there was there was one big family dinner i went to with you and your extended family and it played out exactly that way i was part of this big rambunctious confrontational political discussion that covered several you know topics and i would not say i was the center of attention but i was one of the most you know charismatic voices there were three three or four guys all kind of contending with each other and everyone else is the women were watching silently no woman spoke during that conversation and then when women did speak because i did stand around with the women when they were talking and much much more uh solemn voices uh they were talking there was a girl who had a new boyfriend and the boyfriend already had a kid from a former yeah yeah yeah so but yeah of course but the point is to be blunt women were talking about dick yeah to be blunt i guess that's true in a word they were talking about their own sex lives and the sex lives of the younger women were there what was going that was what we were talking about and then to some extent who's getting married yeah having a baby to some extent trivial things like new cars or things too yeah that was it was really our job yeah and you know the men's conversation which again entertained people to some extent was really yeah right so look you know i think that we've done a good job here of adam breeding the culture on on the whole yeah you know the other big thing that's changed is you know now women play video games just like men okay yeah women play video games women become psychiatric uh drug addicts women are dealing with all these other distractions it's equality in all these other ways today right yeah yeah well no equal access to placing no but right but for women it's even worse because there are lower standards of lifetime i think if women get into playstation it doesn't matter what video games you know whatever kind of video games nobody's going to say to them bruh man up like bro you got like you know what i mean like with men there might not be that many people but no i mean like i think it's this whole bigotry of low expectations thing right oh good for you oh you're taking some time oh good you do live streaming video games oh like where just the expectation is there the expectation is there is nothing more serious you could be doing or should be doing you know with your time and with men yeah people do i shouldn't i read the biography of a guy who committed suicide that's why they wrote his biography or the power of this guy who killed himself and uh he went from being addicted to those video games like call of duty to actually join the army and that was part of his process of people saying to him look you're wasting your life playing this video game if this is what you like why don't you actually get out and start doing some arms training and stuff and he did and then he commits suicide this is a long story yeah that that's why they're possible but i'm just saying there are people who will say to a man look you ought to take yourself more seriously you ought to take life more seriously actions have consequences and so i'm saying yeah i'm agreeing with you women have all the same temptations and distractions but then they're the lower expectations you know okay i i think that is true um look i i don't know how much it's it's different from the different genders though with this situation because of course you're more likely to have friends if you are a young man who plays video games because many other young men play video games and they want friends who also play video games but women women it's even more no because they have men trying to sleep with them yeah like through the no no no no no no everybody wants to be their friend they're a female voice on the voice chat no no no no and there are men sending the money and trying to buy their underwear and all this no we're going but no i think you're wrong there the amount of attention female gamers get it's actually live streaming so i was gonna say here too you know um frida says uh she doesn't know many women who play video games this includes iphone ipad like it's not just console gaming and yeah the sims right that's right funny i've read the sims for so many hours as a child it is so embarrassing anyway yeah that's one of those we never talk about never comes up yes and uh but my point is this goes beyond console gaming into all kinds of other gaming thumbs up if you've been uh if you've been a former addict of the sims give the video a thumbs up guys more people will join the conversation more people see it once it's once it's a video just helps us reach an audience who might be interested in some of the stuff but anyway there are real statistics on this guys it's true that women do not play the same video games as men to generalize when you're looking at the population of millions of people around the world but yeah uh games like animal crossing they have a pretty precise statistical knowledge of for how many hours women are logged in for how many hours they're playing for games like candy crush on mobile phones for like so many different games there are games that women actually prefer that they play more that they play for more hours than that yeah and you know as i recall even the gambling games even uh uh you know uh even you know card games like poker and so on you know that's uh that that stuff they do there is actually a mass audience okay yeah i i believe you on that um yeah so i am glad that when i was in when i was in college i think there's there there was the the beginnings of this streaming culture of women playing video games however i didn't play games like that so i wasn't exposed to that um i did play video games in college and i deeply regret it uh and if i could say you know relating to the title of this this video quitting video games and being an intellectual as a woman like yeah i do regret that i will never get a chance to be 19 years old again and at this great university where right i think i think it's one of one of the best universities that i could have attended at that at that age and at that stage in my life like i had the opportunity to do independent research on my own actually get serious about my life and take myself seriously and i didn't and you could have learned latin and you could have learned greek and you could have learned economics and you learned nothing you learned how to play the sims yeah what i would want to say to you and mario galaxy she played mario galaxy one hundred percent during universities and mario galaxy too go on yeah that's true so yeah what i would want to say to young women is like there will be people who will try to write you off or just say like stop taking yourself so seriously like let's just let's just relax and have fun like no you should take yourself seriously and if you aren't going to take yourself seriously now why would it be easier when you're 25 when you're 30 years old to then become a more intellectual person to to care more and to read more books um this doesn't get easier as as you get older like it's something that you should start building when you're that age rather than playing dude and let me just say again you know being an intellectual has nothing to do with how you earn your money you can be a stripper and be an intellectual well it's not easy but you know you can be a waitress and be an intellectual you can be an army officer and be an intellectual like it really doesn't have to do with how you earn your money and for the vast majority of people globally and within the united states of america there is no way to earn your living using your brain you know just give you you could work at a garage repairing cars you repair cars for a living but you're also like you know just say that's that's also really underrated and it's certainly for women it's even more underrated there's no sense you know there's no sense of be a man there's no sense of man up there's no sense of you know yeah yeah yeah um so yeah oliver says people will lower their expectations for young men though for cooking extremely badly for example gender roles are real so this is something i was thinking about earlier this week because uh you remember at one point in time we were training to become bakers we were indeed yeah and uh you pointed out to me you reminded me which is it's great to have somebody it's great to be in a relationship with somebody who who holds you accountable like reminds you of things that you've done because uh yeah it's easy to just let yourself off the hook and having somebody who holds you to higher standards uh he reminded me that at that time uh just the difficulty of being encouraging to me to to read to uh build myself up intellectually and what i was doing at the time was frittering my time away uh baking bread uh making homemade soy milk like trying to be a zero waste homemaker type of person and i i do think that a lot of the exposure to older women uh on the internet at the time was was influencing me that like there are these kind of paradigms or paragons of femininity that i see online like women who have children who manage to cook whole food plant-based diet for all their children they manage to grow their own food and live this kind of lifestyle this zero waste lifestyle this uh vacationing in hawaii lifestyle you know um that definitely had an influence on me and i i really thought that i was building myself into this person that you know a real woman like being a real woman you have to have all these things down where where you're able to be responsible for taking care of children while maintaining a beautiful physique while maintaining uh your kitchen and all these and all these different things that um you know at some points i've i have felt resentful about that that like men don't have that same kind of expectation put on them that same kind of expectation for their role so yeah um i would be curious to hear like what you think about that what do you think about um the the kind of on social media what women are exposed to for so long i disagree i think the point you're making i disagree with oliver's point entirely okay in our culture still to this day when you say chef they think ma'am being serious about cuisine and i'm sorry i can i can even say this about you and i can say this about other women who are involved in that college program there was this attitude including the guy who was the ceo of the college the guy who was the head it's like okay if you're a man you're serious about being a chef you're serious about being a baker if you're a career baker the the gender role is that you're a man and you're quite a domineering uh details oriented man you're a man who's you know really you know like being an architect or something you're a man with a steel trap mind and you're expected to be a bit of an [ __ ] that's the role of being the chef you're the head chef for this bakery you're in charge that's a male gender role right you're a baker you're a pastry chef yeah james is gemini right okay but like look and the point was the attitude and i mean i think even melissa was was kind of a uh you know victim of this to my understanding you know we just talked about it to say coming to this like as opposed to women like oh you know you're just learning to bake for fun you're just learning like you know this is part of the enjoyment of life that's part of the relaxation like you you even saw that that's really true yeah experience yes we want to learn how to make like right on a massive scale we want to talk about industrial scale how to turn a profit how to right how to do this on time on a schedule and it's like oh no no just you know this is the you know this is your grandma with your grandkids going we don't want to make one pie we don't want to make one tart we want to make 100 vegan tarts this is not about grandma doing something nice on the weekend or something so i'm sorry but my point is to say a direct response to to oliver no even in cuisine standards are lower for women even in cuisine even in that professional setting of being a chef being a baker what i saw was instead the gender roles were like men are the guys who take it stairs and women can't even be expected to lift a 10 pound sack of flour can't be expected to know the differences between the different kinds of weeds that's right yeah women can't be expected to have this steel trap mind approach so even there i saw it so sorry the bigotry of low expectation thing i just want to say i've seen that everywhere including cuisine including baking including cooking as a professional or getting involved with that at the at the college level okay so you may you made a difference rescue point do you remember what it was so i was curious what you had to say about the kind of male like the differences between um female role models like yes there is this idea that like we should look up to hillary clinton as a female role model yeah but yeah if you are thinking of just like social media if you're thinking of youtube the kind of the kind of person that's okay so i'm gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you what it's it's really brief but it's really deep okay the difference is today women have a nearly infinite variety of choices because of the internet because of social media and as a result things have gotten worse now what do i mean so back in the 1950s and 1960s in canada there was like one female role model on cbc television and she was you can imagine she was an intelligent well put together woman who did the kind of news commentary show and did interviews okay and i know it's sick to say but of course it was an incredibly wholesome influence on the women of canada it was like look this is the kind of adult you can be you know what i mean and that's it you didn't have a choice there were maybe four tv stations and if you change to the bbc if you watch british television because in canada at that time there was a lot of you know cultural connections to their cultural connections to england you had a similarly kind of phony presentation of a highly intellectual professional woman on camera and of course it's fake she's reading a script and this isn't who she really is or something i mean you had a very small number of female role models that were chosen for you you know 1950s or 1960s that way you know today instead what you have is the relative infinity of youtube the relative infinity of facebook the internet generally yeah and people are allowed to seek out and select the role models they prefer for example on instagram and there you see instead this snowballing effect where women who are vain justify their vanity by picking role models who are vain women who want to be for example women who want to be a marijuana smoking hippie with dreadlocks who dabbles in hindu mysticism they're going to select women on youtube on instagram oh i love her they're picking role models they're picking examples for emulation that are exaggerating their own fundamentally self-destructive self-indulgent and stupid tendencies okay so that is what i see on on a massive scale you know now it's very different it's very difficult to challenge a woman by saying hey why don't you go on instagram and you only select accounts of women who are the type of person you want to be right even with books you and i were joking we had one book written by a female we have a huge bookshelf i could wheel it over we've seen it in the background recently melissa made a video we have a lot of books now in this right it's huge by my standards most of my life i've been poor and moved from one apartment next and never owned books this is the most these are the most books i've owned in one apartment one time in my life but we have a lot of books in this department now by my standards because i never had the luxury of living one place and building a book collection but you know we had like one book by a female author and i joked with melissa i said hey what if we organize our library on two shelves we have all the books by male authors on one shelf and all the books by female authors like do we even have two books by a female and the one book by a female author the point is like if as a woman you challenge yourself to look up to intellectual role models on instagram what have you got right nothing and it's very hard to i'm not saying there's nobody but like should you oh why don't you go follow jacqueline glenn i mean what remember i remember where jaclyn glenn was five years ago eight years ago there probably were some young women the oh jacqueline glenn she's a strong educated woman she's studying to be a medical doctor she's in med school she's an atheist she talks about the theory of evolution okay we'll look at her today today she has fake tits she sells sign photographs of herself in a bikini she advertises dildos she does youtube videos look at the camera talking about the dildo gave her an orgasm that's announced that's really going to be a family youtuber because she just had a baby who the [ __ ] knows yeah right you know you know what whatever degeneracy she goes on to next but you know my point is like if you were someone looking for a female intellectual idol on instagram on youtube but even at the library even taking books off the shelf at the library even published authors and women with phds right it's really slim it's really glam grim but the point is the woman doing the selecting the woman looking on instagram the woman the person who's in the audience right what would motivate them to do that as opposed to just hey i'm gonna look for youtubers that make me feel bad about my own bad habits that reinforce my vices like i'm vain i'm gonna look for a youtube channel that makes me feel better about my vanity you know whatever you're a [ __ ] so you subscribe to sex positive channels that are taking back the word [ __ ] and encouraging you to go out and sleep with a hundred guys a year that exists you know there were men who do this also by the way it's just that's not the topic of this video really and i have made videos i have made a lot of videos criticizing men's sexuality and the way men justify i really have but anyway no but there are women who do that on the opposite extreme there are women who are christian conservatives who only want everyone to have sex with one guy and want to be part of this christian marriage and they seek out those youtube channels but like the point is what you see in that self-affirming cycle uh it it makes the question as you posed it almost irrelevant that's how that's how role models die okay that people get to choose their role you take a [ __ ] look at the choices you might recall how i introduced that was that you had reminded me that i was frittering my time away at that time uh by making homemade soy milk and trying to do more base my life around more zero waste habits and so on so yes i think that's a good observation that now that we have this freedom we can choose to basically reinforce our own beliefs by whom we follow uh yes i i do think at that time i was it's not like i i look up looked up to anybody as an idol but i did probably i probably was seeking out that content rather than looking for sure i wasn't looking for the social media presence of female authors or you know i wasn't really paying attention much to female politicians at that time so yeah i do think that's that's true but um just kind of the in your face quality of a lot of those those youtube channels where it's just like this is motherhood or like this is what it means to be a real woman or something like even if they don't directly say that it's like oh you have to know how to you know deal with cloth diapers you have to you know like know all this stuff like in advance or whatever like like this is the kind of thing that in the vegan movement at least like that's that's kind of how i felt like yeah you should be fair that you also were drawn to a lot of anti-natalist content that was absolutely yeah yeah right now yeah i know what i'm just saying that's another example where you had a tendency and you were looking for something true absolutely yeah so anyway um but yeah the point is here also video game addicts can just seek out youtube channels that reinforce their life as a video game addict and makes that seem normal yes whatever it is you're into you get into self-justification um whether people are thought of as role models or not yes okay so getting onto this idea of like female authorship versus male authorship and um you know okay one thing is is of course somebody who is a female author somebody who has a phd somebody who is spending their time researching they probably are not going to make a youtube channel talking about their research i mean it might exist like you know it's very very looked into it very much um but um yes i do think that this is still a problem at least with what we've been reading lately that most of the topics that i've been interested in many of the the most important books are written by men still have been written by men and this is something that could be could be changed like this is the generation where like women should be taking themselves seriously and if it's not going to be you then who is it going to be um and when i was younger when i was in college like i just didn't think of myself that way i didn't think that i was i i could have that kind of authorship that kind of authority so so look though i mean this is really bring it back to the very fundamental topic this video is about i have done a lot of research lately that related to books i was trying to buy from ancient greece and ancient rome so this was you know is this translation better than that translation but you know i'm on amazon buying some of these books and and some of them deciding not to buy um you know you can get this stuff on the internet for free if you want if you're okay with a certain type of text reading a certain different format but i was looking up youtube videos about these particular greek and roman authors and sometimes there's nothing sometimes there's never been a single youtube video about that author about that book about that topic which is interesting to see but you know when there were videos made by women the intellectual standard they were holding themselves to was so much lower so there's a video about livy so this is l-i-v-y uh ancient roman historian and there was a woman she'd done two different videos talking about a particular it was just the penguin edition some mainstream edition of of livy and you know her whole manner of speaking and the levels hi guys well i got this version of the book and let me tell you i mean like you know there's i'm i'm really talking about substance here not just style it's possible to say something really substantive in that sing-song style but no she talked like a bimbo she seemed like a bimbo she acted like a bimbo and i've got to tell you the the the content was at dumb bimbo level and just being real that particular woman i think she could do better but you know i don't know her you know if she tried if she had that concept you know what i mean and when i saw other people's videos there was one guy he was a kind of middle-aged not very attractive white guy who did a video on the same thing and he was instead looking at it in terms of the nitty-gritty of the different publishers and the different editions and stuff and the whole tone is different you know what i mean the standard he's and he might not even be aware of it he doesn't sit down in front of the camera and say to himself okay now i've got to say something really intelligent like you know i don't think he's working himself up or something or he's probably not watching the video afterwards and wondering does this live up to my standards like it's something you embody after a certain point where you live your whole life answering to a higher standard and yeah look um i'm sorry but aoc alexandria ocasio-cortez you know what i'm talking about uh if somebody's watching this video 10 years from now when the initials aoc have become meaningless right you know i'm gonna be the queen of america what the [ __ ] aoc is such a [ __ ] she's so stupid and she's not even trying and like you you know you wonder what couldn't you do better you know she has her little crying fits she feels so sad feels her if you know she's sitting there writing on twitter if you want to know why i broke down crying the other day in the middle of that vote on israel and palestine this is why this is the reason because i've been bullied all the time because of my position as your like dude dude man up dude hold yourself to a higher dude [ __ ] your tears [ __ ] your emotions masculinity what do you think we what do you think we elected you for are you supposed to be a leader or a follower or a [ __ ] self-pitying you know slobbering mess like what the [ __ ] is this you know selfie is sobbing a mess i should say um sobbing and slobbering are two different things yes but you know um you know in her whole little breakdown of how she thought she was going to die on january 6th it was full of us my point is like i don't think aoc is born so different from me i don't think this is a biological difference but there's this profoundly corrosive corrupting effect you know of of these lower expectations right and then these people that live their whole lives they've never thought about like well what am i really capable of what's the higher standard i could be aspiring to what should i be trying to live up to you know okay and yeah i think that i think yeah this might relate to something that you've said it wasn't in the last video that the last live stream about advice to young men and quitting video games um but it was a video that you recorded recently or a live stream you were talking about the role of duty and honor and sometimes you talk about bronze age values recently um yes i do think that this is um lacking today i think in both for both genders i don't think it's really that much different uh for men and women um so i've heard what you've had to say about bronze age values for men um about how men will will die for duty will die for honor um what does that mean for women what would you say that yeah it would mean for women and you could say for aoc in this example if she's a politician if if she's been elected what is her duty and what does it mean to be an honorable person okay okay so i'm giving you my 100 real answer okay when my father talked about communism so my father was a communist extremist he wasn't a moderate he was an extremist he's thinking about history he's thinking about what he would have done in different historical situations with the assumption that his life would be on the line he's thinking about getting killed risking his life he's thinking about killing other people he's thinking about living the rest of his life with blood on his hands from those events when my mother is talking about the same [ __ ] history because my mother was also a communist nutcase during my childhood during my teenage years when i was growing up right my mother is thinking like oh men would take care of that oh other people would fight and die and kill and be killed and that doesn't have to do with me she's thinking she gets to sit here on her throne knitting while other people fight and die on a really deep level there's a refusal to take responsibility or refuse to see oneself as equal and to see oneself as equally implicated you know like it's blood on your hands too like you're also part of the war effort you know one way or another like if you're a woman and you're a nurse in the war like i understand you're not pulling the trigger but you're there you're part you're a woman you're cooking food in a tent for the army like you know you can explore in the army in a million ways like you know i understand a very small number of women have a combat role but you know they're women who are helicopter today they're women to do all kinds of things but if you know go back 50 years there were very few roles for women in the military but still of really seeing yourself not as a passenger in politics not as a passenger in history but as being in the driver's seat you know i'm just saying this is a contrast with my father and my mother have i personally ever known any exception to the rule have i known any woman who reads about history thinks about history talks about history feels about history you know the way my father did the way i do the way most men who take these things seriously do no never and just give you a funny example this is this is a pretty funny harmless example um my ex-wife went to a phd conference some kind of academic conference or colloquium and i think everyone there had a phd in anthropology or they were a student in the process of getting their phd is a pretty elite kind of events these are all supposedly highlighted people maybe a few people were there from sociology some other department this is an illegal and so i'm sorry i'm probably garbling this story to some extent this is not super accurate it's a really it's a really short story and uh you know someone does a presentation that involves or mentions uh female circumcision widespread throughout the muslim world and there's a good-looking white woman in the audience then the presentation ends and it's question time so this is like phd level q a and she stands up and she said well i think we should fly over there and bomb those people and force them to stop doing wow and like this is low and a lot of these fields they're like majority female i think the majority of people this event are female and one is just presented or female and it's like well if they won't stop doing this like the army force and the whole way of talking about it like i'm just saying no i'm not a lot of men are stupid a lot like 90 percent okay most men are stupid this is not about difference intelligence it's very different if a man sits there and says look i feel that this issue is so serious that i would be willing to join the army i would be willing to put my life on the line for five years for 10 years and go out news and you know what i feel that if my own son were to go out and fight for this and kill people for this and maybe die for this or come back injured for this i think that would be worth fighting it's not just a difference in tone of voice right there's a difference between a fundamentally passive view of the world like well you know the boys should go and take care of this issue like you should go solve this for me you should go solve this problem i'm gonna sit here and pass judgment about what's right and what's wrong and then other people are gonna sell the problem like no and i'm sorry but for me in a more subtle way this came up again and again with the 2020 discussions about police reform oh right so like you know you had it was there were a lot of women in the discussion including a lot of black women african-american women yeah yeah and like you know okay you are making this statement about how social workers instead of the police should reply to 9-1-1 calls okay and again those people should do that okay all right it's very different if you say you're putting yourself in the driver's seat as someone who might do that job someone's experiencing them and say look somebody says look i know what it's like to show up at someone's apartment at two o'clock in the morning and they're going crazy and you're not sure if you're gonna get shot or stabbed like i know what it's like to be the police in that position like you're a police officer you get a domestic violence call and there's a man and a woman and there's at least maybe they're holding a knife you don't know if there's a knife and a gun involved you're coming into this apartment and they're they're maybe they're both high on drugs or they're drunk this okay domestic violence you've got to come in and break it up right and and guess what i know that if you send in a psychiatrist or you send in a social worker they are going to be it's going to be just as hard for them or harder and they're going to have a gun and we're going to see like to really talk it through and to really say hey you know what the police are doing a hard job and i can imagine how hard it would be for me too and to say hey i'm willing to do that job too i'm willing to sign up and spend five or ten years of my life putting my neck on the line and you know it's not just some social worker who do a better job i think i could do a better job and i recognize i recognize how hard that is to walk into the room and there were two people trying to beat each other up and i have to i have to break them yeah i have to shut this down without putting my own life in danger and without shooting and killing one of them like you see what i'm saying seeing history in the driver's seat seeing that way so sorry i know this it may seem like a small thing but i think this is one of the deepest and most pervasive differences you know between between men and women seen in aggregate seen on a scale of millions of people okay are there exceptions i'm sure there are i'm sure there are some women who think i've never met one just including all these women i knew with pgs i have never met one who thinks about politics in the present tense this way police military in the presence nor historically who look back and think by the way but i have met the opposite i have met effeminate gay men who have attitudes whether you know what it's just a choice i guess i have met a feminist gay men who have a kind of dismissive passive attitude towards history that way okay other people should conquer afghanistan other people should get rid of the taliban and there's no real there's none of that real thought and commitment yeah okay yeah that's that's i think i mean i think now i think that's the difference between you now versus you five years ago i think yeah yeah yeah yeah but like when you yeah even if it's a war that has nothing to do with you reading the war and thinking about that thing about the council you're starting to personalize it so i have more ownership yeah before i met you i'd started taking on more of this like personal responsibility in terms of like living more ethical lifestyle like i embraced veganism like and uh right around the time that i met you i i embraced sobriety you know like i took on these these different aspects of like what i did with my own time but i it is true like it has taken me quite some time and and i still do struggle with like feeling like i have authority like i have some kind of say in what happens in the world around me you know but if if if not by this age like at what stage am i going to feel that way am i going to build up the knowledge and capabilities of like being able to influence going to a town hall meeting like going to city hall and and presenting on these issues you know like at some point you have to step it up and you have to if you really care about these issues you know and i don't want to be just screaming at people on the street and protests about veganism you know i don't want to let you let people you don't want to sound as dumb as aoc for you too when you listen to aoc making some of these things like you know that's true yeah i don't want to feel dumb when i see myself on youtube or whatever on twitter that's true yeah yeah yeah but yeah i'm just giving it a real world comparison yeah yeah i know that's true um if i if i ever do get the chance to be in a leadership role um you know i yeah that that is oh okay so this this could relate to one thing as well that i wanted to discuss um we've seen a bunch of mothers giving their political opinion lately you know you don't want to sound like an idiot like that yes yes mothers giving their opinion about what books should be taught to their children in school yes this is the kind of thing that has been in the news a lot lately so uh something that i thought about more um since i started my relationship with you so it's been close to five years and um because i had this experience with uh um being involved with your daughter when when we were able to see your daughter you know um it really got me thinking that the responsibilities that that come with having a child some you know for for everybody like everybody's responsibility when they have a child is to to teach their children um and we it's it's very obvious to me when i think about it in in the in the home like with parents and children that that is part of your responsibility like your children is your children are going to ask you a lot of questions and you have to be able to respond you have to be able to answer um and and if if you don't then you're setting your child up to be ignorant um but uh it's it's not as easy to see it outside of that context i think for a lot of people when they have to think of themselves as political entities or like people uh who could be interviewed on the news or something you know about a certain issue um or if the you know people who make youtube videos they know like this pressure to to feel like they're saying something worthwhile something that that can make a difference um and actually educating people that that has really shifted throughout throughout my years of knowing you um and and growing into somebody that like feels like they would be able to answer a question so um you know something that's simple uh something that's come up in conversation with with you um when you were a child you remember asking uh you remember that your mother asked you about the tides how the tides were yes um so this is this kind of role reversal where you would think that the mother would be teaching the son about how the tides work um but then isil as well was in this position from a young age of like teaching his own parents you know yeah um so so this is this is this kind of backwards thing where like you know once you start considering like taking on this role of being a mother or like taking on this role of like having some kind of authority in the world um mothering other people in some other sense yeah uh you know what do you really know and like all the years that you should have been preparing for your for if you've been playing video games if you've been uh making homemade soy milk or something like in some ways like that's just gonna set you up for failure set you up for being a dumb person so so look too so there there was a woman and you will see melissa is not disturbed by my image of this there was a woman who basically tried to steal me away from you and you were this relationship was never in any in any uh danger that way and it wasn't clear when she started talking to me probably wasn't clear to her either that's what she was she was after she started talking to me and you know whatever i didn't know that was what was up and said she also might not have known does that but a couple months later she revealed she said look that what she wants is for me to dump melissa and get together with this other woman instead and she is a conventionally good-looking blonde and she just can't imagine how i how i look at this because you know for her for her as a woman you know and i was trying to be friends with she's someone i'd known you know on and off for a couple years someone i you know she's vegan and i can say some positive things about her but sir you're asking the question of like once you become a parent once you become a mother what do you have to teach somebody like what do you have to offer like for this woman like the way she lived her life i would not say she's an alcoholic or anything like that but it's that working for the weekend lifestyle she's going out and drinking alcohol and partying she's living a really shallow meaningless life that revolves around in my opinion fancy shoes and going out with friends and drinking and partying and she was someone who had had sex or one night stands with an alarming number of complete strangers both living this kind of club opening lifestyle remember those ages ago we talked about this yeah you know but like now you know i did not say this to her and she can't imagine seeing it this way her perspective on life is that she's a good-looking woman and practically every guy absolutely wants to get with her the moment she opens the door a crack i mean remember i i told you about this too because this is at the stage wasn't clear like is she trying to seduce me or what i remember one of the things she said to me is she said look you know the fact that i'm talking to you at all means a lot you know it means something yeah yeah yeah she kind of then it's like a couple months after that it's like yeah like you know what you know um you know i had effectively friends on her but my point is this like it had not occurred to her she had never thought like from my perspective from the perspective of a guy like me like she is bringing nothing to this relationship she is not she has absolutely no intellectual substance now i don't i can't you know i can't say too much about this but uh during the time that i was talking to her there were really remarkable political events unfolding that i was talking to melissa about and any of you were my personal friends i was talking to these so i'm it was 2020. you know i'll just say but there were these big political events happening in 2020 and i was getting inspired to write my book i think i hadn't started writing the book yet but i'm reading about this politics and i'm talking about listen about any other friends i had at that time talking to them about what's going on politically yeah and when i try to talk to her when i try to talk to this good looking blonde there is there is nothing there is no i might as well be talking to a wall right so that's what i mean like we're not talking about the intellectual stance you're being being incredibly high but you know my fundamental point is just like she was someone who i mean it had not occurred to her you know what i mean like oh if you want this kind of man if you want this kind of life and indeed you know if you want to move on to being a good parent you know if you want to be a good woman like no like your intellectual development your intellectual substance and your political acumen those that all really matters and i do think she's an example of someone who lived the life of being a good looking blonde in america where these things are at a real premium and just you know just never held herself to any higher standard never yeah yeah that's yeah and you guys already know i did i did mention the way that ended was me saying to her look you know it's not it's i basically look the situation is not like i'm with melissa therefore i can't be with you i said to her really clearly um there is no parallel universe where you and i would become a couple like if i weren't with melissa if i were single like you have to understand this is you know you you would not be it's and it's for this reason so yeah you know now look um i'm not going to make the claim that men are by contrast omniscient or something but of course you know the vast majority of men get that the vast majority of men understand that women women do not want to be with a stupid man they do not want to be with a fool you know that you know the vast majority of women there's you know there's a very obvious pressure on you you were talking about the role of a mother talk about the role of being a father that women do expect whether it's articulated or not they expect you to be a man of substance a man you know so i'm that that's there and um yeah in my whole life i think i've only ever talked to one man who didn't get that but i mean with the exception of some really mentally disabled people i think all men know that there is this pressure on them all the time and then how they deal with it and what they do with it that's another story because for sure some escape into a life of drug addiction and video games like some of them try to evade it or whatever but yeah that there was this this big experience and what do you want to say more with that i mean no i i uh i think i covered what i wanted to say about that yeah um but yeah okay let me just say this i don't think any man would need you to explain to him why he's being rejected if he's rejected for not being smart enough not being substantive enough not being intellectual enough like it's not gonna be like what you know this is this never and you know that was a situation with a woman where like like despite the fact that she's watched my youtube videos for years whatever it's like it hasn't occurred to her that what i'm about is the life of the mind and like say just giving this out as advice for everyone you know if you have really great sex with somebody still i'm taking a walk with melissa the other day and it's like look what makes this walk pleasant it's not the smoothness of the sidewalk it's not the color of the sky it's not the sight of the ocean it's taking a walk with you it's taking a walk with someone who's worth talking to it's taking a walk with someone you intellectually respect someone with something intelligent to say back to you like you know having a you're going to walk with someone you have you're attracted you have great sex with like true in the absence of the life of the mind it's really nothing more yeah no okay yeah i guess i could say more just but that you know i think i think we've sure did a good job of talking about that um yeah i i guess um you got conclusions no the conclusion is it's hopeless well no it kind of relates to something else that i wanted to say um yeah i do i do find that funny that she said it means a lot that i'm talking to you yes i told you about that at the time too yeah i guess i had forgotten that but yeah um you know what what she had a boyfriend at that time oh really yeah [ __ ] that was the other thing she had a boy i had a girlfriend she had a boyfriend and you're telling me it means alone what do you think that you have to offer though like when when you are talking with people you know um yeah i i don't have very uh inflated ideas about about what i what i have to offer in a conversation or what i have to offer other people um but yeah i know that is that is funny to me um okay you you look you say that but in a specific context it's not true so i'll give you a specific context we both decided not to study here at the university of victoria right long story short we were considering we both went up to the university campus no if you were sitting and talking to those kids you're talking to a typical let's say 19 year old doesn't matter if they're male or female and like you may not think you know a lot about the politics of china or the politics of japan or whatever has come up the politics of hong kong for example currently unfolding but you do and when you be sitting down in that context with those kids having those conversations be like no no that's not what the situation's like in hong kong at all you know xinjiang you know western china like no no look so i mean i it's kind of easy for you to say that that you don't feel you have sunday now another example is vegan activism if you're sitting down with other frankly it doesn't matter if they're 19 or 39 you could be sitting down with other people who are super gung-ho about being an activism but they don't know what you know and you're like look it's not like that like i know something i have something to share so it's fine for you to say that but i really think ian praxis in any kind of social context you sit down in that's really not true that you are aware of what you have to contribute and the ways in which you can really help other people whether or not you do because you can just sit there silently you can just sit there listening to people who are talking about vegan activism right how they're gonna volunteer for dxd you can just sit there talking and listening to people talk about xinjiang or the myanmar or rohingya muslims you sit there just like yeah like you said but but you are not unaware even if you're silent but even if you're silent you know you know that you have something that's all i'm saying go on yeah but it would be it would take effort to to try to prove somebody or you know try to convince somebody that what they're saying is ignorant or they they just aren't aware of certain things yeah and uh also you don't want to make people break down crying okay like right this kind of um you know social so this is also this is also gender coded massively right you saw me sit down with the university professors this is not a student it's a professor yeah he said a bunch of crass [ __ ] about xinjiang and i basically said i didn't want to change talking conversation i said look we're not going to get in touch with xinjiang but look i can tell you've never read one book on this subject you don't know what you're talking about you're repeating stuff you read in the new york times you don't [ __ ] you don't know the first book in the entire right and that was a conversation that was very much man-to-man you know it really was and you know i wasn't being mean-spirited i wasn't trying to be denigrating him but you know he's a university professor i am a student and that was a real challenge as an authority and you got to see how we dealt with it that was neither the first nor the last challenges they were like throughout that whole conversation there were a whole bunch of points where i was basically telling them look you're talking out of your hat you don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking about and i do i know a lot about that and you know you see how that goes yeah now i think most you've seen me demonstrate it i think most women in our culture but in every culture i'm familiar with they don't know i have a conversation with that oh yeah and uh whether that's fear-based or fragility-based or what you know like and you could try you've seen me do it what i mean um you could try and both sides might not know how to handle it like if you talk to a woman that way you know how is she going to respond if you talk to a man that way how's he going you know and that that's running up against exactly this whole culture of holding women to lower standards and for real if you had said to that same professor the same things i said i don't think he would have fought back the way he did with me not really yeah sure i'm not i'm not saying he's a bad guy i'm just saying without being caught i think probably the response you go oh good for you oh good for you dear there would have been more oh so you've read some books about santiago's you know like good for you all that's great good to hear good to hear you're you know i think you you really get more of this kind of thing you know yeah and not like look bro i just you know i just showed the emperor has no clothes and the emperor is you yeah you know you're you know you're ignorant and a liar frankly and i've just shown it you know that i'm not just saying with the one incident that happened again and again in that conversation my professor just said okay so the last time that we talked about this or that you had a podcast or you had a live stream that you were talking about like advice for young men you mentioned that you didn't get into topics of sexuality um i would say we've succeeded again in this in this live stream with not really discussing um as i've i've seen the audience the chat has has kind of veered off into some topics about sexuality and relationships and so on so i don't know do you feel like we've we've reached a point but look maybe dude or do you think that we should go on other topics because i'm open-minded look maybe that's got to be a separate a separate live stream where we just talk about the sexy stuff for for both genders yeah but you know it is supposed to be about the life of the mind and being an intellectual yes and i mean i think the very basic point that's been alluded to again and again without getting into it in greater depth is just you know okay this is an obstacle to the life of the mind and it's an obstacle for women in a way that it isn't for men go on okay but i will say one thing that i could say here is uh you know in relation to your romantic life your your love life and your sex life it really does matter who you get involved with of course and yes from personal experience like take it from me like it's it's really important to be with somebody that's that's going to continue to learn so you know i don't trivialize this at all if anything i mellow dramatize it i i exaggerate this news but look i knew a man he was a white guy and he lost his virginity with a prostitute in the philippines he flew to the philippines that was his first sexual experience of women and that was not the i don't know how many prostitutes to slept with but he slept with some number of prostitutes since then asian prostitutes that impacted and influenced the rest of his life on so many levels like there's no way to exaggerate the warping distorting effect that had on his intellectual development his emotional development his ethical development right yeah from his teenage years forward now so like now it's very easy to draw some advice from that my advice is don't sleep with [ __ ] you know um you know whatever especially if you're under 25 years old or something if you're a young man don't sleep with prostitutes i really think it'll do harm to you as a as as a young man being the client not talking about the prostitutes you know i really think this can this can affect you in ways you you yourself as a teenage teenage man can't understand that's my my advice on that okay so obviously for women that is not the problem i mean how many women lost their virginity by paying a male prostitute like it's going to be incredibly close to zero you know what i mean for how many women is their sexual development warped because they are the client they are the john as we say paying someone it's not it's yeah but for women yeah but for women instead you have this avalanche of male attention coming into your life right and you know i'm sorry but there was there was a comment above it's it's now many minutes ago of someone's saying that she does have women in her family who are medical doctors and surgeons but they only get positive feedback they will get appreciation from the family when they cook a seven course meal when they cook a big dinner that's what's rewarded well you know for the most part for women for many years their life starting at a shockingly young age and continuing you know but like you know certainly throughout their teenage years what women find is rewarded is a certain kind of sexually salacious activity you know so sure that that becomes this massive you know source of influence in women's life and in their intellectual development and you know i i think it's yeah it's a huge part of it and i you know i um for many years i wanted to like really separate my intellectual life from my sexual life like or you know thoughts about sexuality are inherently degenerate and like are not related to discussions about philosophy history like you know let's let's completely separate these issues but like i really think that sexuality is is a part of everybody's life everybody has a sexuality and and dealing with that discovering that and exploring that like um and and understanding yourself like that that is something that um it's not separate from from your intellectual life it's not separate from what you're what you're researching or what you're what you're reading about you know um but look i have never met a woman who openly said i don't have to read about politics and history and philosophy because i'm beautiful but i have met so many women who implicitly believe that and like it's not that hidden behind us like they're they will they will pretty they will they will say that to you yeah no no no and that's incredibly [ __ ] up no no no no no no but that's the culture we live that's the century we live in no like for real and nobody's gonna hold the higher standard and they never hold themselves to higher standard and no man is ever gonna say to them and nobody within their family is gonna say to them nobody gives a [ __ ] that you have big tits you know like whatever it is that makes them stand nobody gives a [ __ ] that you have a nice ass that ain't worth [ __ ] you know you have to hit the books you have to accomplish something you have to be somebody you have to make something out of yourself you know [ __ ] you you shallow vain imbecile you know what was it okay but if you have a dude who has that attitude you know there are good looking guys there are guys who get behind their looks yeah right absolutely but a man would feel ashamed to say that or exhibit attitude i mean he's at least going to keep up the illusion that he's a refined intellectual so it's maybe complete [ __ ] you know yeah you know i'm just saying my point is the obstructive nature of female vanity in our culture in our century in all the cultures i'm i'm familiar with that has this really amazing like whatever you say toxic effect corrosive effect on female intellectual development emotional development you know everything else or they haven't even considered now look we have a new book out there's a hit book out by um well okay look little water is laughing says lmao my ass is pretty um we just watched a video the other day from this girl and that's all she cares about this youtuber who was talking about having pretty face privilege and pretty ass privilege yeah she's like now she got a [ __ ] she got plastic surgery on her ass that bigger i said now when i go to the nightclub i'm that [ __ ] everyone pays like that's those are the [ __ ] horizons of her of her life you know a lot of intellectual development over the years zero hasn't read a book since high school my ass is not big that's her whole life compared to the music videos i watch so so no woman will ever say to you that their whole life consists of competing for male attention or competing with other women for who's the prettiest woman in the office or who's the prettiest woman in their in their classroom but like dude a lot of women live their whole lives by those rules you know that's what's going on for a lot of women all the time and has this massively mentally deadening effect you know and it doesn't it doesn't have to i mean it doesn't have to how many hours a day are you doing your hair and makeup yeah you know what i mean like it's just like if you want to be beautiful okay check done for some people it is effortless some people don't have to put any effort into being beautiful they're born with what it takes and now okay now what about actually developing yourself as an intellectual as an author or as a creative person as an analytical person however you want to think of it yeah one of my essays in college was about my choice not to wear makeup if i had really been more objective about my writing i could have you know there's a way to make that essay interesting but like man it's embarrassing to look back on that but you know like my perspective on it you've shown me some of your colleges right yeah yeah no my college writing and didn't i i got ideas straight a's in all of my english courses like nobody was told you do a higher standard yeah my professors i i thought it was a pretty good writer because all my professors gave me a's and no one's saying this would never be published i didn't even think that no no it was just like this is for this no nobody said yes you know nobody said you should compare yourself to the greatest authors in your field and try to be at that level no there's no way i could write like whole soy and i couldn't write well you can but that's what yeah certainly no no right no no i i thought of myself as yeah no no no way um so yeah that is just interesting to reflect on that um uh in that same class actually i had a fellow student who wrote her essay because this was a writing class and we were trying to talk about personal experiences so her essay was about her experience being a cam girl so somebody who was close to my age maybe she was a year older or something because i was i was young from a grade but you know somebody who had been through a lot more sexually than i had you know had put herself out there way more than i had you know like i would have never considered going into porn i would have never considered being a cannibal at that age at that stage in my life but like you know she had already developed this way like this this this mature way of thinking about her sexuality about about commodifying her sexuality making money it's true yeah her sexuality as her career yes yeah and it's somewhat destructive and you know she talked about um in response to my essay about makeup she talked about like for her like it's it's she was a makeup addict like she was always buying new makeup and stuff and at the time i was just like wow i mean like that's what you're spending your time on you're spending your time on like putting dildos inside of you on camera and putting makeup on your face like for this audience and stuff you know like that is and she's making money from that you know it's just i'm gonna mention though so there was a comedy called tropic thunder so if you guys you know when i was a kid i was involved in the theater if you spend time in the theater around actors like most of the male actors are also really good-looking guys and they're guys who are there because they're going nuts but a movie like trevor thunder is making fun of male actors but when you're around male actors every single one of them is a pretentious [ __ ] every every single one of them has a stack of books about like philosophy and politics and history and shittiest camera like they're reading nietzsche and talking about nietzsche like was to use a stereo whatever it is they're reading at the time but seriously they can be reading stuff from ancient greek greece too you know there are some jokes in tropic thunder about the about the ancient greeks there's a joke about uh aristophanes like yeah aristophanes it's so hot right now they're these shallow kind of male model like you know they're these good-looking guys really shallow but those guys still they are at least trying like that's what the jokes are about that movie they're still trying to front like they're intellectuals or they're actually trying to be intellectuals they're trying to develop you know when you talk to male male actors you know and i gotta tell you something you hang around female actors and the vast majority of them have this attitude we've been describing they have the attitude of i'm that [ __ ] like i was the prettiest girl in my high school everybody wanted to [ __ ] me you know like everyone makes exceptions for me i get to skip in line you know like whatever they really have the attitude that they're that's it they're a beautiful woman and that's all they ever need to be and that's all they're going to be they have no they feel no pressure on themselves to to pretend to be an intellectual or make any effort to develop that way so yeah that's that you say acting as a microcosm you maybe see that all displayed a little bit more openly you know now i would say also guys at the gym or something guys who are personal trainers you see girls who are female personal trainers female churches and that's it hey i'm high period and the men who are in that role are like well yeah i'm hot but i've studied nutrition i've done this i've done that i know all this technical sports medicine stuff like where you really see this where where men aren't living with the idea of i'm hot and that's all i need to be like that's for me that's the roof that's the limit of this guy you see women who are really limiting themselves because that's how they think of themselves and dude this applies to ugly women as well i cannot tell you how many women i've known who are really unattractive where everything we've just said applies well they just they don't work as actresses they don't work as trainers you know we don't even wanna you know you've grown up from us yeah yeah i'm fat so what plenty of guys want to get with me i'm still fine i'm still yeah absolutely there are women who are still on an ego trip they're fat and they're ugly but they still have men climbing over each other to compete for their attention and stuff and like yeah yeah um yeah i i suppose that is true um i guess it's just what i was thinking at that time uh or to start this is is that uh i do think that you can take a philosophical attitude about sexuality and about beauty and that's really actually something that i would encourage young women to get interested in and and to really live the exam in life in this way like for that that woman who wrote her essay about being a cam girl like at least she was talking about these experiences and in some ways she was more developed than me like sexually of course like i mean she had she had at least had these experiences and talked about these issues with other people uh that i hadn't and and like just in that way having conversations with other people um having these other experiences like you that is part of becoming an intellectual like uh and um being able to converse about about certain issues like rather than looking down your nose at somebody who might engage in those behaviors like um that isn't helpful and and i might have learned something from actually becoming a better like closer to her if i if i had gotten to know her more yes i knew i knew a woman also uh briefly who uh worked as a stripper when she was in college and um i i i again like i wish i would have made the effort to get to know her a little bit more because i might have just learned about that right that aspect of life um that aspect of human sexuality and and embracing like feminine sexuality like in ways that i was too uncomfortable to talk to talk about at that time so yeah and i do think that can be part of intellectual development um just getting to know people with different experiences and it can be kind of you know you might think but like look you're getting the fundamental implicit point of this whole video is don't let your sexuality be a limit to or an obstacle to your intellectual development yes your emotional development so that is the point yeah like you live in a body we all do yes you know yeah definitely yeah but it is but for the vast majority of people it is they never get over it they never deal with the building blocks of what it is to have a meaningful life or what it is just be a human being on planet earth they never get past it they never get over it i think middle age and old age are very miserable for those people that's all they learn how to do you know what what is old age going to be like for emily ratakowski you know emily ratakowski has just published her [ __ ] autobiography her political essay my body my body right and i'm sorry but emily radakowski her whole fate has been shaped by the the way her body looks and the way her face looks she also has a very striking face her facial features are very clearly delineated and everyone told her i forgot starting when she was 14 years old or something right people told her look you can have a career in my life right well guess what that that didn't mean you couldn't develop intellectually in 10 different ways that doesn't mean you couldn't have you know she'd be in a better position than alexandria ocasio-cortez who started a career as a waitress or whatever you know doesn't mean you couldn't have become a major political leader or a major author but she's a [ __ ] bimbo she's an idiot i'm sorry look at any live interview any unscripted interview she's done i don't care how many [ __ ] ghost writers she worked with in putting that book together if the book has a little bit of intelligence i don't care watch any interview with her she like everything that's wrong with america is wrong with emily radakowski she's a horrifying glimpse into the you know mainstream middle class american mind and she is a pretty girl who cares about shoes and clothes and that's it she like my point being the fact that you made your living out of your body didn't have to prevent you from developing intellectually right but it does for the vast majority of people it provides the pretext or the excuse for that and at the opposite extreme so like you know i was friends with this youtuber american unicorn she was a virgin until marriage and she let that ruin her life she was on the super trad con you know a conservative religious virgin telemanagement that [ __ ] up her life like your sexuality can screw up your life and like commodifying your sexuality in that sense can screw up your life in in more ways than one it can be that you're committed to being a virgin until marriage then you drop out of college get pregnant and raise kids the first person who has sex with you and that ruins your life instead you know so no i mean the the the relationships you have as i put it right at the very beginning of of the uh the video letting someone come into your life letting a man commit your life and solve all your problems yeah that's right i remember that's an incredible temptation even if there's no pornography involved there's no modeling involved there's no they're not being an actress you're just becoming a housewife or whatever you have you know where that's and again there's no reason for that to be all you are you could have all these ambitions you could do all these you'd be a housewife and you can still develop yourself and you know you can accomplish all kinds of great things that's true and the vast majority do not the vast majority let this be an obstacle let this be a limit to their to their learning and they shut down and they remain fundamentally childish stupid ignorant people all their lives yeah so to avoid that well i i did not live my life in an intellectual way when i was a young woman when i was 19 20 and 21. 21 i can imagine an alternate universe where i would have really taken myself seriously and and stuck to the kind of high expectations that i had for like how i how i behaved like in high school when i was sober when i when i didn't surround myself with people who were doing drugs and so on like if i if i had just stuck to some of these kind of um good qualities of how i how i live my life um yeah i can imagine that i would have i would have read a lot more and i would have pushed myself more but also if if people would have held me to higher standards if my professors would have like you said like encouraged me to write at a level that i would feel comfortable publishing this like how many people are going to read this and and uh yeah if if you think of yourself as somebody who could become an author one day or something who could change the world in some way um you know your your your outlook on life your your perspective on yourself and your perspective on your role in the world will change a lot um so yeah that that is the advice that i would have for young women is to uh imagine that in the future you you you know part of what you said in in one of in your last uh live stream about advice for young men is like you can't part of your role as an older person is to tell young people what they can't imagine yeah and um so yeah i feel like although i'm i'm not as old as you like i do kind of feel like i'm at a some at a stage where i can say that like you can't imagine the kind of people that you'll know in 10 years you can't imagine the type of person that you'll be in 10 years or uh you can't imagine the regrets that you might have about how you're living your life right now um and and i mean that's part of the tragedy of life is that we don't know what we're going to regret but it's better to regret that you you tried your best to become a more intellectual person um it's better to regret that you you you didn't go out and party or something you know that you didn't uh waste your time when you're younger playing video games if you if you have regrets about your life when you're a youth that are related to that like oh i wish i would have wasted more time i wish i would have gone to more clubs or something like it's it's way better to be in a position where you actually learn something and uh you push yourself intellectually you know i think it's true probably something i overlook about myself was just the assumption that i was gonna be an author and i remember talking to other young people that went this was the era before youtube when you know i didn't assume i was making monologues so i was going to be writing but you know like once you have that view of what it is to be an adult that being an adult means being an author well it doesn't matter that much what your major is in university because whatever it is you're preparing to be an author right like you're preparing to write you're going to change the world through writing or share whatever you you have to share to speak for yourself you know as a writer you know um you know but i mean to give an example for a long time i considered going into law getting a law degree which is incredibly boring but if you're thinking about being a writer if you're like yeah but really i'm gonna write books that you know that's what really matters like however it doesn't matter if i work at 7-eleven or starbucks or work as a lawyer but i'm trying to cultivate myself to be an author that's ultimately what really matters yeah and then also you've been with me in person i consider going to business school and getting a degree in business but i'm not doing that instead of being an author like i'm still thinking of myself as a creative writer if someone is doing research someone who's learning and someone who's writing you know yes so i already had that idea like at 15 or 16 or something and then in an unseen way that guides all my development and yeah you know i think the tragedy is there are a lot of women who just regard themselves as a piece of ass there are a lot of women they don't think of themselves as an author it's never crossed their minds yeah exactly that their intellectual development right and and you know i think the flip side of that there are now there are some men some men think of themselves as a piece of ass but i would say what's much more common is that men think of themselves that way in terms of money where men reduce themselves to just how much money they are and how much they pay for things including paying for the attention of women where they've reduced themselves to being a kind of economic atom and economic cog in the system yeah you know as opposed to saying well no you can earn money lots of different ways you can work in real estate and be an intellectual you know as mentioned you can be a stripper and be an intellectual you can develop yourself as an author you can change the world and you change who you are too you grow and you you know yeah but yeah i know we're having this conversation after the death of the publishing industry so that model you know if you take the word author in its dictionary sense i can't say that anymore now you have to talk more broadly about being some kind of creative artist some kind of content creator you know uh but still but still i really do think that you know there are some comments maybe everybody's not smart enough somebody says some people just aren't very bright though drinking and partying may be all they can manage unless things okay so no i don't believe it for an instant going in yeah i think we all have something to offer and i when i was younger what i was told about being a professor is that it can be uh demanding because there's this idea of publish or perish like you have to publish um but i do think that this is something that is healthy for people to continue to challenge themselves as to to think of themselves as people who publish something who are who are trying to make something um throughout throughout their life i mean uh doing something with their time even if it's just on a small scale of like in your community if you're if you're making some effort to but look sorry i i just made a video the day before yesterday or something about tana mongeau the fact that all taniman joe can appreciate today is getting drunk and partying that does not mean that's all she's capable of appreciating vegan she used to care about veganism and like talk about it like that what i totally think i totally think she's someone of above average intelligence which is scary but it's the [ __ ] truth but you live that way long enough you lower your expectations yourself long enough and this seems like the only thing you can enjoy same with video game edition there are people who say oh well they're too stupid to enjoy anything but playing video games because that's all they know how to enjoy they don't know how to get the value out of you know research and writing all kinds of other humanitarian work or climbing a mountain or anything else you know but like they don't they don't know how to enjoy the life of the mind is really what i'm emphasizing here rather than climbing a mountain um you know but no i don't believe that about tana mongeau and i don't believe that about uh emily ratajkowski i don't think she's born dumb she's someone who made the wrong choices she chooses to be dumb and now this is who she is and this is all she can enjoy and she still could change in the next 10 years the next 20 years it'll take time and hard work you know what i mean and i'd encourage you to emily if you're watching this now you know but you you know it's not too late to take life seriously and really live with that you know with the sorrow and the joy that comes with the life of the mind and take that on but no i don't believe that for an instant you know and and my view of the world where i say like 90 percent of people are fundamentally stupid and malign fundamentally stupid enough bad intentions are malicious it's even more tragic when you understand that what i'm saying is that they choose this people choose to live this way the same way they choose to play video games the fact that you play video games like the only thing you can enjoy doing is playing video games you were not born this way you're not it's not because you're mentally disabled right and then you get into a cycle a self-justifying cycle of uh you know the meaningless a meaningless life you know yeah you want to say those to wrap it up babe i mean you know i think i think we've said it all yeah i think how would it be how to be a woman according to most of them um that's funny i hadn't thought of how to actually end this now to conclude this video i mean because it's something that i'm still learning about and i'm i'm still embracing you know as i get older like my my feminine like being being a woman what it means to be a woman and to it it was interesting to me to hear you say that you've you've never felt that any woman that you've known has has viewed history in the way that men have that they've actually like been taking on this role yeah um if they're going to have a view on the war on afghanistan kind of sympathizing actively put it that way yeah right um so yeah i don't think it's impossible for women to think of themselves as active participants in in history as it unfolds like i don't uh and there are plenty of women in history that we have to look up to um women that uh you know involved with auntie go on yeah sorry but if you if you're keeping it real the gentleman that's not true i'm talking about your own life who are the women in history you've looked up to you haven't had anything i mean you were saying that earlier it's just why say the opposite of the truth i mean you know okay it's true i i do i haven't you personally you don't you don't think this is hillary clinton or something like you know but i'm thinking about condoleezza rice you don't look up to her you know you don't i mean you haven't grown up with women whether now from the past i don't think you do just just keep me real i'm not faulting you i'm saying you know look i had to name my daughter and so when i was with my my ex-wife and she gets it was a planned pregnancy even wasn't an accidental person we planning to pray and give pride it's like okay we have a list of really great names for a boy that are historical figures right and then like for a girl it's like uh i guess it's just one like it was so hard to come up with it you know female intellectuals in history you look up to or think positive there aren't a lot like i'm we're just keeping it real here people and like you know i did i gave my daughter a name i'm proud of the name i gave her i'm happy with the name i gave her but i didn't have 10 other names i didn't have a list of really great names from great historical figures it's like okay i guess i could name her after this one historical figure now i've used up all my good female baby names you know and they were like they're all these different male names that's so we sort of just joke around today about good names for good news real boy and stuff yeah no i'm just saying you haven't lived up with with plenty you haven't grown up with plenty of female uh i guess positive you grew up with britney spears okay all right fine i guess but you know figures from history that i was told about you know somebody like rosa parks or somebody like harriet tubman like you know that was that was the kind of influence that i had when i was around yeah okay okay so let's see okay okay rosa parks was she an intellectual was she a great writer was she an inspiring leader no not harriet tubman saying no like it's just keep it real no you don't grow up with female role models look up to you don't you know or there are incredibly few yeah again maybe there are some interesting exceptions to the rule i mean you know look at this shelf of books you know who do we have of any of the authors of any of these books you know who do you have to look up to who's female there i think there's one book written by a woman on our bookshelf and it sucks i think my angela was a communist right at least at least a sympathizer anyway don't get into people's books you haven't read i mean if you haven't read it don't comment yeah um yeah so i but you know i just say no i mean rosa parks it's not an exception you know you know i'm sorry i mean mary curie is not an exception none of these people you know none of these people are tolstoy none of these people are mohandas gandhi and you know i'm a critic of gandhi but no none of these people are major intellectuals and creative right and you know people who you know change the world by living the life of the mind they're not you know now look my ex-girlfriend one of them um she wanted to be a painter and i remember her going through these different magazine articles she was actively looking for examples of successful female painters and so this is interesting this ends up being a kind of counter story she found this article and it was like the next generation of modern artists female modern artists in the 21st century and it was someone who had done like a survey mission who are the hot new female painters painters and sculptors uh in the arts today and then 10 years later did a retrospective saying where are they now and the article she wrote it's a female author was like completely condemning these women and saying well guess what it seems like the vast majority of women just don't care about anything except getting pregnant having kids and like the majority of the women who were in the exhibition 10 years ago they found a wealthy husband and got pregnant to have kids and they don't produce art anymore and they don't take it seriously and like here are the one or two exceptions and here's what they're doing it's like well and like the article concluded because basically none of them were doing important new art or even devoting their time to art anymore some of them were still doing it as a side project so well guess what i guess the reason why in our generation there aren't like major inspiring female intellectuals in painting is that there really aren't women who make this their priority and dedicate their lives to it the way men do men who say like no nothing like this is my art this is what matters this is what i'm giving 110. and i remember anyway just remember that was her situation she was someone again she'd been a feminist and she'd been involved in women's studies but she she had to admit she's like well all of the artists she looks up to or anyone just they're all men you know okay and another thing you know because i'm vegan it is also striking to me that like so few people in history generally but also we're vegan like i don't have a lot of positive vegan role models it's a female when you were doing ancient history of veganism stuff yeah it's all male authors and male 1 yeah that's true so yeah yeah i hope i hope this changes i mean it is one of the aspects when you do if you want to have kids i mean it does take up i was just challenging you about the casualness of saying and passing are there like are there like i feel i've been in a couple of the fields that are exceptions like buddhist philosophy buddhist studies there are some major females keep it real and no it's part of your problem like there weren't i mean who you going to look up to emily radekowski you're going to look up to uh christina aguilera christina aguilera who was on tv during your childhood that's your generation who the [ __ ] are you going to look up to you know and who right now there were women who would say look up to aoc alexandria cause of course she's a [ __ ] knitwit she's an idiot the women who are the leaders of black lives matter are idiots and they have published books and their books prove that they're idiots so you know like this is so here are your choices oh wow inspiring female intellectuals and authors there should be there should be tons of them you know what i'm saying but no but and by the way again i'm not saying there was zero the field i worked in when i was a scholar of buddhism there were important uh women in that field it's an unusual field that way you can be in fields that are that are dominated by women yeah but yeah it's it's scarce my point is no it is rare okay does having a family preclude women from doing meaningful intellectual work yes it shouldn't that's part of what you know it's not just me a lot of women are conflicted about this issue and yeah i i had a newborn baby in my arms and i was swinging her back and forth to put her to sleep and it was very muscular work with that particular baby and i was listening to thucydides history of the peloponnesian war on my headphones and i heard the whole of herodotus the histories as an audiobook you know actually i was actually reading through cities on paper listening to erotic as an audiobook i was developing intellectually and when the baby fell asleep and i put her in the crib i did bench press i did push ups i did upright row i was working out physically i was working intellectually and i was a full-time stay-at-home parent i was taking care of the baby i was cleaning everything at night i was cooking for my wife often my wife would be breastfeeding the baby and then i'd go and cook in the kitchen yeah you can be an intellectual raising a kid or you can take it as a [ __ ] excuse to have a meaningless self-indulgent life that's what most people do i mean most most for most men it's money for most men it's like well i earn money so that's it so now i have excuse i can turn my brain off i can have no other aspirations but yeah for a lot of women it's not for some women it is money but for a lot of women it's not even money you know okay isil i do appreciate you challenging me on that i it could be just the kind of influence that i had in school that oh yeah say it again and again no we all repeat this oh there are lots of positive female no like let's let's look sorry there's some other field where it's not about that's not about you know uh uh gender but you know like some people say oh well there are lots of positive atheist role models and i would say really like you know like look around who are the atheist leaders or something you know male and female there were other things where i would challenge like oh well you know let's let's really think about it you know what i mean yeah no i think that's good and that's that's important so we'll question that look everything that is a challenge is also an opportunity okay and look being born a six foot three scary looking dude is a challenge it has disadvantages and i could be self-pitying and talk about the ways in which it's [ __ ] up my life and yeah i've had to deal with police coming at me a certain kind of way i really have as a young man as a teenager i've had to deal with all kinds of hostility and being treated like [ __ ] by authority figures you know being a scary looking big white dude it's a challenge it's also an opportunity and i mean look i think the fundamental message coming out of this this video is if you're born female if you're living your life female you know look at those challenges and appreciate the extent to which there are opportunities being a parent is an opportunity yeah having a raising a child being a housewife is an opportunity being a stripper or being a camp girl is an opportunity but also you know going to university hitting the book studying challenging yourself to reach a level of excellence challenging yourself not to just be a passenger in history but to be in the driver's seat taking an active rather than a passive role you know holding yourself to standards where you know you know not everyone gets to be napoleon in this life you know one person in a billion gets to be napoleon but you know you get to be the napoleon of your field you get to be the protagonist of your life you know within your small life within the small sphere where you're going to influence things you are going to be the most important person you are going to have you know power and influence and consequence for the people the people around you you know so you know take seriously this is your one life this is your one opportunity whether you become a librarian or you become a stripper whether you're celibate until marriage or you you literally become a prostitute you know all the temptations all the advantages and all the opportunities presented by the body you happen to be born into you have to treat them as positive opportunities to live a meaningful life and not let them be an obstacle to the life of the mind not let them be an excuse for you to live a fundamentally self-indulgent life in which you dissipate the intellectual potential that every single one of you was born with even if you exercise that potential so little at this point that you don't know just how far you can take it you don't know yet what it is that you're capable"},{"id":"mv7PDqEIiTE","text":"this is the most important information in the western world at this moment in history dare i say it and this is the evidence right if you go and deliver leaflets in the uk broadly speaking and arguably anywhere in a western city deal with 5 000 leaflets most of their people they're going to get it aren't bothered right well they're so like repressed they're not going to respond but that one percent of people right 5 000 leaflets maybe 10 000 people look at it right 30 to 50 people arrive at a talk these are the people they're going to change the regime like these are the low walls and this is the key thing four people will be prepared to be arrested engaging seal two people will be prepared to go to prison so here we are this is the most important part of this talk go and do the maps [Music] right in most western democracies if say 3 000 people are arrested then you'll get legislative change right in most western democracies if three 400 people go to prison you'll get legitimate change [Music] you have just been presented with the appealing myth that all you need to do is print enough pamphlets to motivate enough people to get themselves arrested to achieve legislative change in any western democracy and we are even given a precise ratio between the number of pamphlets to be printed the number of people who go to prison and you can crunch the numbers and do the math for just how many million pamphlets this would take challenge yourself think this through for a political set of demands an ideological movement that you have no sympathy with whatsoever in every western country there are some people who would prefer to have sharia law they're not afraid to go to prison for it it's a minority they're a very vocal very well organized minority in paris in berlin in new york in california there are passionate devout members of the muslim faith who would prefer to be under sharia law or some kind of muslim majority government do they believe that if just 3 000 of them go to prison it'll bring about their desired legislative change if you look today in britain it's capitalism secularism freedom liberty cannot provide the solutions for people so at a time like this it's actually quite important for muslims to vote especially with the sort of rise of islamophobia voting for a legislator instead of god it is the greater evil about you know that is the greatest evil voting itself it is the greatest crime afford against god much worse than uh all of the crimes of christ the people who are behind bars without trial i don't know where you stand on the abortion issue i've made many youtube videos discussing it from many different angles do you have any doubt in your mind that in the united states of america that in england that in france there are 3 000 people in each of those countries who aren't just willing to print pamphlets who are willing to be arrested who are willing to go to prison to change the laws on abortion you know what you can say it both ways there are people going to jail to make abortion illegal and there are people willing to go to jail to make abortion much more readily available in all of these western countries why is it that they don't believe that 5 000 pamphlets or 3 000 people in prison will accomplish that legislative change and and and and haven't they already tried it aren't they engaged in these sorts of methods right now is it really a purely hypothetical question we're asking or is this something that has in our times within our lives already been tried tested pushed to its limits and utterly debunked this youtube video is in part a political critique of a particular leader of a particular movement of a particular ideological tendency in our times but as with the vast majority of my videos it also provides a more general sort of education in how to use your mind to destroy the ready-made meanings that are presented to you in our society in our culture on the internet on television on the radio in the newspapers one of the most fundamental functions of the human mind is to tear apart complex ideas into their constituent parts to see the cracks in the facade of the appealing image presented to us by ideologues whether those be radical dissidents or whether those be members of the establishment [Music] [Music] how many people in the united states of america are willing to not just print pamphlets on paper but go to jail to support the state of israel and how many are willing to not just print pamphlets but go to jail because of their opposition to the state of israel one way or another whether they be anti-semitic or pro-palestinian or part of the left-wing bds movement there's all kinds of different voices in that chorus you think there's any shortage you think it's fewer than 3 000 people you see how such an appealing illusion starts to fall apart but he doesn't have to convince you and i he's only trying to convince a tiny minority of the audience that he refers to as lone wolves these are the people they're going to change the regime like these are the lone wolves he knows that his words only have to make sense to a tiny minority of desperate people to bring about the outcomes that he's really seeking changing history changing the world in six months is all about disruption plus numbers the situation is you've got your five people and the standard model that's happening in the western world at the moment and it's a little bit speculative but you know it's a robust robust potentiality as they say right she's got your five people your five people they're going through an extended hunger strike or they go and paint on a building or block a motorway and it's filmed and they go to prison for a week two weeks that's step one and beforehand they make the videos about it and there's loads of detail in this point right and it goes on social media and twenty thousand people watch it and then they come out and it's not like hey i'm gonna go and have a holiday no they're doing a job you're in prison you come out you're on to the job what is the job you're then on to your tour right you know mostly if you king used to do like five five speeches a day that's how you change history you don't go oh i'm off to recover now it's like that's how you change history you know have two days off and then you're out around the country doing a tour talking to people okay and people go oh my god this person's gone to prison here's here's a pathway to actual action i'll do it as well and they sign up so you go again right eight weeks later note the time not like four months later like two weeks right you go once you've got those 50 people so 50 people go to prison if 50 people go to prison in this country right newspaper people have said it'll be on the front page it's major right this isn't a fetishization of prism by the way right this is causing disruption putting the authorities in a dilemma and they go okay we're going to take this disruption and give them loads of publicity or we put money in prison and we give them lots of publicity it's a win-win non-violence properly designed is always a win-win so there's 50 people going to prison and you know what happens next right this is non-linearity they're out proactively designed civil resistance this is the heart of this video's proposition right you've got your five people you've got your 50 people the 50 people go to prison they come out they all do 20 meetings each in four weeks that produces your massive takeoff right your moment where you're going to get a thousand people prepared to block the motorways block the infrastructure whatever it is and they're prepared to go to prison we are now living through the last few months of 2021. do you think there were fewer than 3 000 people willing to go to prison to overturn the election of joe biden and instead install donald trump how many people on january 6th in washington dc were willing to go to prison to change history with non-violent methods by this very same definition of non-violence and what were the real outcomes of their struggle in the months since then how many thousand people have been willing to go to prison over the vaccination issue and how well organized and well funded any of these groups do you think vegans are as well organized and well-funded as the crazy abortion people do you think do you think they ever will be do you think ecologists will ever have the sense of mission and purpose motivation that we saw shine so brightly during the year 2020 in response to the brutal killing of george floyd in broad daylight on videotape with witnesses do you think there were fewer than 3 000 people willing to go to jail when they were demanding fundamental social political legal change after the police killed george floyd just in the year 2020 did anyone even need to print pamphlets the response in all these examples it was so visceral it was so immediate it was so extreme and it mobilized not hundreds of people not dozens of people not thousands we're talking about tens of thousands or millions of people rising up around the world and demanding change and yes non-violently by this by this very strange definition of non-violence that really includes quite a considerable amount of violence when you think about it if we can't say that this ideology has been discredited if we can't say that this methodology has proven to us all that it does not work now then when the pattern that i see is that one demagogue after another rises up preaching non-violence achieves absolutely none of his or her outcomes uh none of the legal legislative political changes that are demanded but what they do achieve is their own personal wealth and fame and as soon as they are caked out in the parlance of our times like the leaders of black lives matter suddenly they seem a lot less interested in leading a movement of radical dissonance suddenly they seem very highly motivated indeed to become members of the establishment instead of wiggling against it that for me is the lesson of history and i think if i were going to foretell the future six months from now one year from now five years from now that's the future i foretell for the leaders of extinction rebellion such as roger hallam that you've just seen in your screen they will go on to the same kind of comfortable life as the leaders of people for the ethical treatment of animals and so many other once radical movements that have come and gone of being invited occasionally to appear on the news as a talking head to give their you know esteemed opinion on the issues of the day well they've built up for themselves a comfortable bank account a retirement fund and a perpetual position on a tour on a speaking circuit that never ends what they have secured for themselves is money fame power respect and sex not necessarily in that order once they've got that we see just how little radicalism is left in them and you know the funny thing is it's you and i who get to choose we get to choose our leaders whereas the leaders of this world they don't get to choose their followers roger hallam puts this message out there and he has no idea what kind of stupid malevolent people are going to take those orders and how they're going to interpret them and how they're going to apply them and how many people are going to die and what the consequences will be we get to choose our leaders they don't get to choose us and that's why in politics nobody knows what will happen next [Music] maybe we can we can practice"},{"id":"tdq6Oiq6ydA","text":"[Music] or not [Music] [Applause] [Music]"},{"id":"xMWEP49YQ_o","text":"boris johnson the prime minister in the uk everyone's going to be looking at him so he's going to be going around you know shaking hands of kids at school planting a few trees making these announcements all this that's when you want to go and expose his gross obscene hypocrisy right because he's weak in 2022 he's not going to care about the climate christ he's moved on right so that's the moment to strike okay and like on that diagram i showed then there's the 9 11. then there's the 9 11. then there's the 9 11. then there's these massive crises you have to act fast you know if hundreds of people have died in germany because of the floods you need that small group to go right we're going to have this big demonstration now in 24 hours you're going to make that fast decision that's why you need a small group is to react to these spontaneous moments when the opposition is weak or to design something when you are going to maximize the probability in other words strategic intelligence we're not going next year we're going now right we're going when they're weak on our we're we're determining the moment of resistance number three is high level disruptive action okay so again this is like totally foundational you're not going to be in the ballpark of catching that ball going down the road down the hill unless you engage in high level disruptive action that's an absolute no-brainer at this point in history we've got three years to turn around the crisis in the six-month plan we have to go in there with something massively transgressive massively disruptive massively outrageous if you're not doing that you're not in the ballpark because you've got to capture mass attention to change history to change how the society is going to work this is the complete opposite of performative protest right it's about material disruption it's about material disruption if we're going to challenge the absolute obscenity of the plan to destroy the next generation we have to go in with something that's outrageously disruptive to say to the general public to say to the government this is outrageous and we're not standing for it and we're doing whatever it non-violently takes to push that into your face that's how history changes so it means blocking motorways or blocking ports right blocking the center of cities it means unlimited hunger strikes it's classical non-violence right people get hurt sometimes people get killed people get hurt sometimes people get killed an ideology can never be discredited you can disillusion particular believers but the belief remains like a disembodied ghost the belief in marxist economics it still circles the globe it doesn't matter how many millions of people have been killed it doesn't matter how many true believers later lost their faith and wrote autobiographies reflecting on it it doesn't matter in how many classrooms in front of how many chalkboards people can prove theoretically that marxist economics can't be made to work and it doesn't matter how many people just sincerely and sadly say that they tried their best to take these ideas and implement them but the outcomes were horrible and disastrous believers lose their beliefs believers grow old and die and yet their beliefs never disappear they continue to haunt humanity and find new souls who are so foolish or so mean spirited as to believe in them non-violence is yet another ideology and i know how hard it is to get you to question it i mean communism has the same fundamental advantage going for it it has a catchy name it sounds so positive it sounds so appealing don't we all want to believe in community or don't we all want to live in a commune you know we could call it the togetherness ideology oh it sounds so positive it sounds so uplifting non-violence what could be wrong with that roger hallam the leader of extinction rebellion he's a very instructive example of exactly what's wrong with non-violence right now in the 21st century i don't have to go back a long way here i don't have to reach back to the examples of the vietnam war or whatever the year 2020 was it such a long time ago can't you remember the protests that destroyed one city after another from coast to coast in the united states of america demanding justice demanding legal reforms demanding something fundamental change in the system of policing and the courts something fundamental has to be changed in the constitution of the united states of america were those protests non-violent were they and were they successful if we can't look back at the non-violent protests of 2020 and both admit to ourselves that they were a failure and honestly examine why then we can never move out from under the shadow of this ideology that strangely still hovers above us all this belief in non-violent protest now roger hallam is partly the leader of a real political movement but he's partly a youtuber just like myself he's someone who sits down in front of a camera and it's one of his most powerful one of his most effective ways of communicating with people organizing emoting people is doing exactly the same thing i'm doing with you now in one important respect it really reminds me of the youtubers i've seen who are trying to make money and trying to build up a big fan following by teaching you the secrets to learning a new language learning french is hard learning german is hard oh but it doesn't have to be trust me believe in me sign up now i've got the secret i've got the methodology i've got the technique i've got this one trick that can make it so much easier for you to learn a language have you ever tried to learn chinese japanese even for a day or two have you ever felt desperate to have a charismatic self-confident person speak to you through the screen standing there as a sage on a stage telling you that they know the secret they know what you're doing wrong and then to engage in one discussion of methodology after another the real point of which is just to establish their own unimpeachable authority as a leader as someone deserving your donations your respect ultimately your obedience [Laughter] i mean language learning it's what goes on between a grandmother and a grandchild it's something caring and informal and repetitious you know it's something you kind of can't buy at any price when it's done right if you could adopt a new grandmother you could learn any language in the world and if you had the patience to live with her and wash dishes with her and she had the patience to keep correcting you while speaking with you in chinese or while speaking with you in french while you wash the dishes together right but what you're going to see on youtube fundamentally because people are trying to earn your devotion and earn your donations is instead an approach that presents you with one more sophisticated methodology after another there's always something new to say about method method method and the reality is there is no method in the world good enough that it can make learning chinese easy and there is no method so bad so ineffective that you can't learn the language despite it just with enough hard work effort practice repetition that grandmother who moves in with you and washes dishes with you every day even if she is a stuttering alcoholic you can win language trust me there's a very strange parallel between the vegan activist group direct action everywhere and extinction rebellion both of them came onto the world stage promising that they had a method that would work as never before that it was something fundamentally new and different from what any other protest movement had attempted before because their method was based on social science research other political leaders would supposedly just appeal to your emotions your sentiments your biases but here was someone claiming that they knew how to change the world they knew how to achieve political progress on the basis of certain scientific facts donate now as with so many language learning gurus as with so many exercise gurus weight loss gurus bodybuilding gurus the strange thing is that as soon as you open up the box containing this special methodology it seems like there's really nothing inside it seems that extinction rebellion didn't have any special technique that hadn't already been used for example by people for the ethical treatment of animals oh oh oh people lying down on the sidewalk with chains around their wrists having chained themselves to a fence then forcing the police to take the time to cut through the chains or cut through the fence and extract them and carry them off in an ambulance oh uh uh this this is familiar and what what did you say about social sciences and how were you so sure this was gonna work oh um women who've taken their clothes off and are standing across a bridge blocking traffic nude topless women with slogans written on their skin this is this is the new and different methodology that's going to change the world as as never before this didn't even seem new in the 1980s so what is this ideology of non-violence that on the one hand they claim is completely new and different and can change the world as never before and on the other hand simultaneously they claim hasn't changed since mohandas gandhi in india and that has been proven to work as a consistent pattern again and again throughout history and then let me ask you less facetiously in the audience at what point can we frankly say that this has been discredited and is proven in the same way as marx's economics at what point can we move on to try something really new really innovative really challenging i spoke to roger hallem just once from the audience at a public event and when i stood up in the q a session i pointed out to him that in a really interesting way his lecture was reproducing the defects of the approach already taken by direct action everywhere direct action everywhere said just look at the great success of non-violent protests in the arab spring and then here we were so many years later and i was able to say the arab spring protests were not non-violent they were not successful and on the contrary when you look at them now in retrospect at every stage of the development they were a disaster that's ended up with a huge body count and no appreciable progress towards democracy now here we are roger and he was indeed repackaging this same so-called social science research pointing to this as a success as a victory that proves the efficacy of non-violence instead of looking at this same historical example as proof that what these people call non-violence is in fact incredibly violent and doesn't actually achieve any of its intended outcomes and now here you are roger so many years later and you've added to this litany of supposed success stories the pro-democracy protests in hong kong and i asked them look really really where do you think those protests are going to go from here do you think just a few months from now or a few years from now we're going to be talking about an independent democratic hong kong or do you think there's a chance that the example of hong kong like so many others is going to end in failure it's been a day of glaring absences people traffic police even demonstrators they've melted away leaving a landscape of destruction [Music] we found him staring in disbelief at the trash metro station where someone had gone the extra mile to prevent access people wandering around me are just as bemused as i am remember this is one of the main streets to the center of hong kong right next to the university on a friday afternoon in russia and it's basically a battlefield [Music] his reply was very down to earth and affable and he said like yeah well when you look at it it's like you know 51 49 or 60 40. really the odds aren't that good for any particular non-violent protest movement but you know we kind of you know look at these anecdotes from history and we kind of go with what works um i appreciate his candor what i don't appreciate is that he is now quite literally recruiting people to engage in terrorism and to organize themselves in terror cells and to carry out quote-unquote non-violent disruptions that are only non-violent but the same definition that he applies ludicrously but consistently to tremendously violent episodes in our history like the pro-democracy protest in hong kong like the 2020 george floyd riots and like the arab spring [Music] some are still busy building walls across the middle of a four-lane highway while others are not at all sure what to do next the umbrellas are harmless enough less so the rocks and molotov and in case the protesters suffered existential angst philosophy is at hand in french translation i rebel therefore i am [Music] more than 20 000 desperate angry people watched that video from roger hallam not all of them read aristotle not all of them read thucydides there are some really stupid really malevolent people in that audience and they are going to interpret the vague incitement to disruptive action that he's offering each in their own peculiar way we can't really pretend that roger hallam will be blameless or will have no blood in his hands when one of his followers one of his minions takes his words to mean what they so clearly do mean we live in a world where paradoxically non-violence is nothing more than an ideology preaching violence and promising you outcomes as a certainty whereas the lessons of history show that it has failed again and again but the ultimate lesson of history is no matter how badly or how profoundly or how repeatedly an ideology is debunked it will never disappear particular believers become disillusioned but sadly the belief remains [Music] maybe we can we can practice"}]
